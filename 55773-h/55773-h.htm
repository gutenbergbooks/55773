<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> writing of this book
has been to me no joyful task, as its making has been at the expense
of much-needed rest and peace of mind. In returning to my dear native
land after a long imprisonment, I cherished the hope that I might as
quietly as possible be permitted to take up the threads of outward
existence so cruelly broken, little dreaming that trials hardly less
grievous than those left behind awaited me; for no sooner had I touched
these hospitable shores, when I was met by the fear-inspiring cry,
&#8220;You must write a book&mdash;you must give the world an account
of your sufferings&#8221;&mdash;as if one could never suffer enough.
My well-meaning friends could hardly have known what they were asking
in forcing upon me a mental return to the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> dread past. Solitary
confinement in Woking Prison (as the reader may learn from these pages)
was not such an elysium that one should voluntarily desire to hark
back to it, nor is penal servitude in Aylesbury an Arcadian dream.
While within their grim walls I did my best to exclude from thought
the world without; and now that I am once again in the world (though
scarcely of it), my one desire to shut out all the abhorrent things
which so-called &#8220;prison life&#8221; stands for has thus far not
only failed of realization, but, under conditions even more trying than
the repressive prison r&eacute;gime (because of the free and happy life
all about, which it seemed to poor me that I had some right to share),
I have been compelled by force of circumstance to return to my cast-off
prison shell, and live all the old heart-and-brain-crushing life
over again. However, my second &#8220;trial and imprisonment,&#8221;
like the first, is at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> drawing to a close; and I devoutly trust
that I shall be now permitted to enter upon a long-coveted rest, and
partake as I may of those tempered joys which my countrymen by their
beautiful sympathy have so chivalrously endeavored to make possible for
me.</p>

<p>Theoretically my imprisonment terminated on English soil, but so
relentlessly have the fates pursued me that I have been in nowise free
quite up to the present moment. In Rouen, France, where I sojourned at
my mother&#8217;s home for three weeks, I was as much in durance to my
genial enemy, the ubiquitous reporter, as when the English Government
held me in its inexorable grasp. Our cottage was completely invested by
him, and all approaches and exits held with a persistency which, under
other circumstances, might well have extorted my admiration.</p>

<p>Then came the ever-to-be-remembered<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> sea voyage. I am a good
sailor, and so the physical discomforts that beset so many were
agreeably minimized; but I could not throw off the feeling that I was
not yet free&mdash;the limits of the ship were still all too suggestive
of the narrow exercise grounds of Aylesbury prison; and, while the eye
could roam without hindrance, there came upon me again and again an
irresistible desire, which the rolling billows strenuously gainsaid, to
make a dash for liberty.</p>

<p>Thereupon followed a couple of days at the Holland House, New
York, with the same persistent reporter never absent. After this
experience, I was taken by the kindest of friends to where nature is
at her loveliest and human hearts beat in unison with their uplifting
surroundings. Beautiful Cragsmoor, with its wide reaches of inspiring
scenery, most appropriately the summer home of an artistic colony, is
not too easy of access to mar a desire for<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> seclusion, and a greater
antithesis to prison walls than is afforded by this aerie can hardly be
imagined.</p>

<p>Here all things that on lower planes so cruelly vex the spirit
seem far away and beneath. If only no publishers&mdash;however
benevolent&mdash;had entered this Eden, what a paradise it could have
been to me! However, in spite of these dread taskmasters, my soul
drank deeply of the elixir so bountifully held to my lips; and when in
the golden autumn all the noble woods about robed themselves in such
glory as may be seen nowhere outside my beloved native land&mdash;and
perchance nowhere here more ravishingly than in these Hudson Valley
uplands&mdash;the rapture of my heart, so long starved within the
narrowest and cruelest of confines, turned adoringly to Him who has
made this world so beautiful for His children&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>I need hardly be at pains to say to my<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> readers, that lessons in
literary composition form no part of the disciplinary curriculum of
Aylesbury; nay, the art of writing is distinctly discouraged there,
as interfering with the prescribed parliamentary r&eacute;gime.
Accordingly, when I set out to tell my pitiful little story, I was told
to look at myself objectively; then to pry into myself subjectively;
then to regard both in their relation to the outside world&mdash;to
describe how this, that, or the other affected me; in short, as one of
them, more deep in science than others, expressed it, &#8220;We want as
much as possible of the psychology of your prison life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I surreptitiously looked up that awe-inspiring word in a
dictionary, and found that it refers to the soul, and that it was my
soul they wanted me to lay bare. I vehemently protested that that
belonged to my God, and I had no right to expose it for daws to
peck at. But the publishers, with the aid<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> of my friends,
persuaded me that the public would give me their tenderest regard,
and that possibly the humanities might be furthered a bit if the
story of a woman&mdash;whatever might be her failings in other
directions&mdash;wholly guiltless of the terrible charge of wilful
murder, and for which in her innocence she was made to suffer so
cruelly, be given in fullest heart detail to a sympathetic world. So I
have done what I trust is best for all&mdash;spared myself as little as
possible, lest the picture fail from suppression&mdash;and my dearest
heart-hope is that somewhat of good may come of it, especially in
behalf of those whom a dire fate shall compel to follow in my steps,
with bruised spirits and bleeding feet.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sketch of My Ancestry</span></h3>

<p>I was born at Mobile, Ala., September 3, 1862. In searching for
some account of my genealogy, I found a published letter of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> Gail
Hamilton&#8217;s, who was ever one of my most eloquent and steadfast
champions, and to whom I owe a debt of gratitude I can never adequately
express. From this it appears that I am the great-great-granddaughter
of Rev. Benjamin Thurston, a graduate of Harvard College, who settled
at North Hampton, N. H., and of his wife, Sarah Phillips, who was
the sister of John Phillips, who founded Phillips&#8217; Academy in
Exeter, endowed a professorship in Dartmouth, and contributed funds
to Princeton; and who was the aunt of Samuel Phillips, who founded
Phillips&#8217;s Academy at Andover.</p>

<p>The mother of Sarah Phillips was Elizabeth Green, and from her the
name of Elizabeth has come down in regular descent to myself.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, daughter of Benjamin Thurston and Sarah Phillips, married
James Milk Ingraham. Joseph H. Ingraham, of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> this family, gave to
Portland, Me., for its improvement, property now amounting in value
to millions&mdash;beautiful State Street, the market, the property
of the High School, and much more. One of the Ingrahams was the wife
of Philander Chase, the first Bishop of Illinois, uncle of Salmon
P. Chase, who was Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln and Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Of the Ingraham
family was that Commodore Ingraham who won laurels for his country
and himself by rescuing Martin Koszata from the clutch of Austria.
Connected with the Ingrahams was that Edward Preble, born at Falmouth
Neck, whose father served under Wolfe and was wounded at Quebec; also
that Commander Preble whose achievement before Tripoli was rewarded
with a gold medal and the thanks of Congress. Rev. John Phillips and
Thurston Ingraham, author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> of &#8220;Why We Believe the Bible,&#8221;
both rectors in the Protestant Episcopal Church, were sons of James
Milk Ingraham and Elizabeth Thurston Ingraham. John Ingraham, son of
the preceding, is rector of Grace Church, St. Louis, Mo. His sister,
Elizabeth Thurston Ingraham, married Darius Blake Holbrook, who was
born in Dorchester, Mass. His mother was a Ridgeway. Her sister
married a Quincy, and was aunt to John Quincy Adams. Mr. Holbrook was
an originator of the land grant for the Illinois Central Railroad and
its first president. He owned Cairo, at the mouth of the Ohio, and
was associated with Cyrus Field in laying the first Atlantic cable.
Caroline Elizabeth was the only child of Darius Blake Holbrook and
Elizabeth Thurston Holbrook. She married William G. Chandler, of the
banking house of St. John Powers &amp; Co., Mobile, Ala. William
G. Chandler&#8217;s father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> was Daniel Chandler, a lawyer of high
standing in Georgia; his mother was Sarah Campbell, a sister of John A.
Campbell, at one time Assistant Secretary of State for the Confederacy,
and previously judge of the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge
L. Q. C. Lamar, long a United States Senator, and afterward a justice
of the Supreme Court, was near of kin.</p>

<p>To William G. Chandler and Caroline Elizabeth Holbrook Chandler two
children were born&mdash;Holbrook St. John and Florence Elizabeth.
Their father died in 1863, and their mother, on account of the war,
took the children abroad to be educated. The son died while pursuing
his medical studies.</p>

<p>As will be seen from the above summary of Gail Hamilton&#8217;s
statement, I am descended, on both my paternal and my maternal side
for generations, from good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> American stock. I was educated partly in
Europe and partly in America, under the instruction of masters and
governesses. I was too delicate for college life. I lived partly with
my maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Holbrook, of New York, and partly
with my mother, the Baroness von Roques, whose home was abroad. When
not with them I was visiting or traveling with friends. My life was
much the same as that of any other girl who enjoyed the pleasures of
youth with a happy heart. I was very fond of tracing intricate designs
and copying the old-time churches and cathedrals. My special pastime,
however, was riding, and this I could indulge in to my heart&#8217;s
content when residing with my stepfather, Baron Adolph von Roques,
who, now retired, was at that time a cavalry officer in the Eighth
Cuirassier Regiment of the German army and stationed at Cologne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>At the age of eighteen I married James Maybrick, on the 27th of
July, 1881, at St. James Church, Piccadilly, London, and returned to
America, where we made our home at Norfolk, Va. For business reasons we
settled in a suburb of Liverpool called Aigworth. A son was born to us
on the 24th of March, 1882, and a daughter on June 20, 1886.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER ONE<br />

Before the Trial</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Arrest</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Slowly</span> consciousness
returned. I opened my eyes. The room was in darkness. All was still.
Suddenly the silence was broken by the bang of a closing door which
startled me out of my stupor. Where was I? Why was I alone? What
awful thing had happened? A flash of memory! My husband was dead! I
drifted once more away from the things of sense. Then a voice, as if
a long way off, spoke. A feeling of pain and distress shot through my
body. I opened my eyes in terror. Edwin Maybrick was bending over me
as I lay upon my bed. He had my arms tightly gripped, and was<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> shaking
me violently. &#8220;I want your keys&mdash;do you hear? Where are your
keys?&#8221; he exclaimed harshly. I tried to form a reply, but the
words choked me, and once more I passed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>It is the dawn of a Sabbath day.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
I am still lying in my clothes, neglected and uncared for; without
food since the morning of the day before. Consciousness came and went.
During one of these interludes Michael Maybrick entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nurse,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am going up to London. Mrs.
Maybrick is no longer mistress of this house. As one of the executors I
forbid you to allow her to leave this room. I hold you responsible in
my absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then left the room. What did he mean? How dare he humble me thus
in the presence of a stranger?</p>

<p>Toward the night of the same day I said to the nurse, &#8220;I wish
to see my children.&#8221; She took no notice. My voice was weak,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> and I
thought perhaps she had not heard. &#8220;Nurse,&#8221; I repeated,
&#8220;I want to see my children.&#8221; She walked up to my bed, and
in a cold, deliberate voice replied: &#8220;You can not see Master
James and Miss Gladys. Mr. Michael Maybrick gave orders that they
were to leave the house without seeing you.&#8221; I fell back upon
my pillow, dazed and stricken, weak, helpless, and impotent. Why was
I treated thus? My brain reeled in seeking a reply to this query. At
last I could bear it no longer, and my soul cried out to God to let
me die. A third dreary night, and the day broke once again. I was
still prostrate. The dull pain at my heart, the yearning for my little
children, was becoming unbearable, but I was dumb.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened and Dr. Humphreys entered. He walked
silently to my bedside, felt my pulse, and without a word left the
room. A few minutes later I heard the tramp of many feet coming
up-stairs. They stopped at the door. The<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> nurse advanced, and a
crowd of men entered. One of them stepped to the foot of the bed and
addressed me as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Maybrick, I am superintendent of the police, and I am
about to say something to you. After I have said what I intend to say,
if you reply be careful how you reply, because whatever you say may
be used as evidence against you. Mrs. Maybrick, you are in custody on
suspicion of causing the death of your late husband, James Maybrick,
on the eleventh instant.&#8221; I made no reply, and the crowd passed
out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Prisoner in My Own House</span></h3>

<p>Was I going mad? Did I hear myself accused of poisoning my
husband? Why did not his brothers, who said they had his confidence,
tell the police what all his intimate friends knew, that he was
an arsenic eater? Why was I accused&mdash;I, who had nursed him
assiduously day and night until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> my strength gave out, who had engaged
trained nurses, and advised a consultation of physicians, and had done
all that lay in my power to aid in his recovery? To whom could I appeal
in my extreme distress? I lay ill and confined to my bed, with two
professional nurses attending me, and with a policeman stationed in my
room, although there was not and could not be the slightest chance of
my escaping. The officer would not permit the door to be closed day
or night, and I was denied in my own house, even before the inquest,
the privacy accorded to a convicted prisoner. I asked that a cablegram
be sent to my lawyers in New York. Inspector Baxendale read it, and
then said he did not consider it of importance and should not send
it. I then implored Dr. Humphreys to ask a friendly lawyer, Mr. R. S.
Cleaver, of Liverpool, to come out to see me. After some delay Mr.
Cleaver obtained a permit to enter the house and undertook to represent
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth day came and went. On the fifth day, May 16, the
stillness of the house was broken by the sound of hushed voices and
hurrying footsteps. &#8220;Nurse,&#8221; I exclaimed, when I could no
longer bear the feeling of oppression that possessed me, &#8220;is
anything the matter?&#8221; She turned, and in a cold, harsh voice
replied, &#8220;The funeral starts in an hour.&#8221; &#8220;Whose
funeral?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Your husband&#8217;s,&#8221; the
nurse exclaimed; &#8220;but for you he would have been buried on
Tuesday.&#8221; I stared at her for a moment, and then, trembling
from head to foot, got out of bed and commenced with weak hands to
dress myself. The nurse looked alarmed, and came forward. &#8220;Stand
back!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I will see my husband before he is taken
away.&#8221; She placed herself in front of me; I pushed her aside
and confronted the policeman at the door. &#8220;I demand to see my
husband,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;The law does not permit a person to
be treated as guilty until she is proven so.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>He hesitated, and then said, &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; With tottering
steps, supported by the nurse, I was led into the adjoining room.
Upon the bed stood the coffin, covered with white flowers. It was
already closed. I turned to the policeman and the nurse. &#8220;Leave
me alone with the dead.&#8221; They refused. I then knelt down at the
bedside, and God in His mercy spared my reason by granting me, there
and then, the first tears which many days of suffering had failed to
bring. Death had wiped out the memory of many things. I was thankful
to remember that I had stopped divorce proceedings, and that we had
become reconciled for the children&#8217;s sake. Calmed, I arose and
returned to my room. I sat down near a window, still weeping. Suddenly
the harsh voice of a nurse broke on my ears: &#8220;If you wish to see
the last of the husband you have poisoned you had better stand up. The
funeral has started.&#8221; I stumbled to my feet and clutched at the
window-sill, where I stood rigid and tearless<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> until the hearse had
passed, and was out of sight, and then I fainted.</p>

<p>When I recovered consciousness I asked why my mother had not been
sent for. No answer was made, but a tardy summons was sent to her at
Paris. When she arrived she came to me at once. What a meeting! She
kissed me, and was speaking a few loving words in French, when the
nurse interposed and said, &#8220;You must speak in English,&#8221;
and the policeman joined in with &#8220;I warn you, madam, that I
will write down all you say,&#8221; and he produced paper and pencil.
I then begged my mother to go into Liverpool to see the Messrs.
Cleaver, who represented me, as they would give her all the information
she required; and then I cried out in the bitterness of my heart,
&#8220;Mother, they all believe me guilty, but I swear to you I am
innocent.&#8221; That night I had a violent attack of hysteria. Two
nurses and the policeman held me down, and when my mother, outraged
by his presence, wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> to take his place and send him from the
room, Nurse Wilson became insolent and turned her out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">At Walton Jail</span></h3>

<p>The next morning, Saturday, the 18th of May, Dr. Hopper and Dr.
Humphreys visited me, to ascertain whether I was in a condition to
permit of formal proceedings taking place in my bedroom. In a few
minutes they gave their consent. The magistrates and others then came
up-stairs.</p>

<p>There were present Colonel Bidwell, Mr. Swift (clerk),
Superintendent Bryning, and my lawyers, the Messrs. Cleaver, Dr.
Hopper, and Dr. Humphreys. I was fully conscious, but too prostrate to
make any movement. Besides those in the room, there were seated outside
the policeman and the nurse. Superintendent Bryning, who had taken
up his position at the foot of the bed, said: &#8220;This person is
Mrs. Maybrick, charged with causing the death<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> of the late James Maybrick.
She is charged with causing his death by administering poison to him. I
understand that her consent is given to a remand, and therefore I need
not introduce nor give evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Swift: &#8220;You ask for a remand for eight days?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold Cleaver: &#8220;I appear for the prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Bidwell: &#8220;Very well; I consent to a remand. That is
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>These gentlemen then departed. The police were in such a hurry
to prefer the formal charge, they could not wait until the doctors
should certify that I was in a fit state to be taken to the court in
the ordinary way. The nurse then told me I must get up and dress. I
prayed that my children might be sent for to bid me good-by&mdash;but
I was peremptorily refused. I begged to gather together some necessary
personal apparel, only to meet with another refusal. I was hurried away
with such unseemly haste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> that even my hand-bag with my toilet
articles was left behind. My mother implored to be allowed to say
good-by, but was denied. She had gone up to her bedroom, so she tells
me, which looked out on the front, to try and see my face as they put
me in the carriage, when they turned the key and locked her in. After I
had gone a policeman unlocked the door.</p>

<img src="images/i039.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="center noindent">THE LATE DR. HELEN DENSMORE,<br />
An American advocate of Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s innocence.</p>
</div>

<p>After a two hours&#8217; drive we arrived at Walton Jail, in the
suburbs of Liverpool. I shuddered as I looked at the tall, gloomy
building. A bell was ringing, and the big iron gates swung back and
allowed us to pass in. I was received by the governor and immediately
led away by a female warder. We crossed a small courtyard and stopped
at a door which she unlocked and relocked. Then we passed down a
narrow passage to a door that led into a dark, gloomy room termed
the &#8220;Reception.&#8221; A bench ran along each side, a bare
wooden table stood in the middle, a weighing-machine by the door,
with a foot measure beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"
id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> it. A female warder asked me to give up
any valuables in my possession. These consisted of a watch, two diamond
rings, and a brooch. They were entered in a book. Then I was asked
to stand upon the weighing-machine, and my weight was duly noted.
These formalities completed, I was led through a building into a cell
especially set apart for sick prisoners. The escort locked me in, and,
utterly exhausted, stricken with a sense of horror and degradation, I
sank upon the stone floor, reiterating, until consciousness left me,
&#8220;Oh, my God, help me&mdash;help me!&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Alone</span></h3>

<p>When I opened my eyes I was in bed and alone. I gazed around.
At the bedside was a chair with a china cup containing milk, and a
plate of bread upon it. The cell was bare. The light struggled in
dimly through a dirty, barred window. The stillness was appalling,
and I felt benumbed&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35"
id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> sense of terrible oppression weighed me
down. If only I could hear once more the sound of a friendly voice!
If only some one would tell whose diabolical mind had conceived and
directed suspicion against me!</p>

<p>I remained in the cell three days, when my lawyer visited me. He
arranged that I was to have a room especially set apart for prisoners
awaiting trial who can afford to pay five shillings ($1.25) weekly, for
the additional comfort of a table, an arm-chair, and a wash-stand. Had
I not been able to do so I should have been consigned to an ordinary
prison cell, and my diet would have been the same as that of convicted
prisoners. Instead, my food was sent from a hotel outside. I was
locked in this room for twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four. The
only time I was permitted to leave it was for chapel in the morning
and an hour&#8217;s exercise in the afternoon in the prison yard.
The stillness, unbroken by any sound from the outside world, got on
my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
nerves, and I wanted to scream, if only to hear my own voice. The
unnatural confinement, without any one to speak to, was torture. The
governor, the doctor, and the chaplain, it is true, came around every
morning, but their visits were of such short duration, and so formal
in their nature, that it was impossible to derive much relief from
conversation with them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Coroner&#8217;s Inquest</span></h3>

<p>On the 28th of May the Coroner&#8217;s inquest was held, but I was
not well enough to attend. I was represented by my legal advisers. On
the 3d of June I was still too ill to appear before the court. Mr.
W. S. Barrett, as magistrate, accompanied by Mr. Swift, the clerk,
held a Magisterial Court at Walton Jail. Mr. R. S. Cleaver did not
attend, having consented to the police obtaining another remand for
a week. Only one newspaper reporter was allowed to be present. I was
accompanied to the visitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&#8217; room by a female warder, and
silently took a seat at the foot of a long table. I was quite composed.
Superintendent Bryning rose from his seat at the end of the room and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This person, sir, is Mrs. Maybrick, who is charged with the
murder of her husband, at Aigburth, on the 11th of last month. I have
to ask that you remand her until Wednesday next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Swift: &#8220;Mr. Cleaver, her solicitor, has sent me a note in
which he consents to a remand until Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett: &#8220;If there is no objection she will be remanded
until Wednesday morning.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Plank for a Bed</span></h3>

<p>The magistrate then signed the document authorizing the remand, and
I withdrew. On the 5th of June the adjourned inquest was held, and I
was taken from jail at half-past eight in the morning to the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Coroner&#8217;s Court in a cab, accompanied by Dr. O&#8217;Hagan, a
female attendant, and a policeman. I was taken into the ante-room for
the purpose of being identified by the witnesses for the prosecution.
I was not taken into court, but at three o&#8217;clock Mr. Holbrook
Gaskell, a magistrate, attended for the purpose of granting another
remand, pending the result of the inquest, and again no evidence
was given in my presence. I was taken to the county police station,
Lark Lane. I passed the night in a cell which contained only a plank
board as a bed. It was dark, damp, dirty, and horrible. A policeman,
taking pity on me, brought me a blanket to lie on. In the adjoining
cell, in a state of intoxication, two men were raving and cursing
throughout the night. I had no light&mdash;there was no one to speak
to. I was kept there three days, until the coroner&#8217;s jury had
returned their verdict. A greengrocer near by, named Mrs. Pretty, to
whom I had occasionally given orders for fruit, sent me in a<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> daily
gift of her best with a note of sympathy&mdash;a deed all the more
striking in its generosity and nobleness, since the charity of none
other of my own sex had reached to that degree of justice to regard me
as innocent until proven guilty.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Verdict of the Coroner&#8217;s Jury</span></h3>

<p>On the 6th of June I was again driven to Garston to hear the
coroner&#8217;s verdict. There was an elaborate array of lawyers,
reporters, and witnesses, as well as many spectators.</p>

<p>I waited in the ante-room until the coroner&#8217;s jury had
summed up. The jury consisted mostly of gentlemen who at one time
had been guests in my own house. Of all former friends present,
there was only one who had the moral courage to approach me and
shake my hand. Throughout the time I sat awaiting the call to
appear before the coroner he remained beside me, speaking words
of encouragement. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"
id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> others, who, without a word of evidence in
my defense, had already judged and condemned me, passed by on the other
side, for had they not already judged and condemned me?</p>

<p>When my name was called a dead hush pervaded the court, and the
coroner said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you agreed upon your verdict, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Foreman: &#8220;We have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Q. &#8220;Do you find that death resulted from the administration of
an irritant poison?&#8221;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;Unanimously.&#8221;</p>

<p>Q. &#8220;Do you say by whom that poison was administered?&#8221;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;By twelve to one we decide that the poison was
administered by Mrs. Maybrick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Q. &#8220;Do you find that the poison was administered with the
intent of taking life?&#8221;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;Twelve of us have come to that conclusion.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The Coroner: &#8220;That amounts to a verdict of murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the requisition was made out in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;That James Maybrick, on the 11th of May, 1889, in the
township of Garston, died from the effects of an irritant poison
administered to him by Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, and so the
jurors say: that the said Florence Elizabeth Maybrick did wilfully,
feloniously, and of malice aforethought kill and murder the said James
Maybrick.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I was then driven back to the Lark Lane Police Station, locked up,
and remained the night. The next day I was returned to Walton Jail.
How shall I describe my feelings? Mere words are utterly inadequate to
do so. Not only was my sense of justice and fair play outraged, but
it seemed to me a frightful danger to personal safety if the police,
on the mere gossip of servants, and where a doctor had been unable to
assign the cause of death, could go into a<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> home and take an inmate
into custody in the way I have shown.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June I was brought before the magistrates, and for
the first time evidence was given in my presence. I had been driven
over to the court-house the evening before, and had passed the night
there in charge of a policeman&#8217;s daughter, who remained in the
room with me. Her father kept watch on the other side of the door.
That night, on going to bed, as I knelt weary and lonely to say my
prayers, I felt a hand on my shoulder and a tearful voice said, softly,
&#8220;Let me hold your hand, Mrs. Maybrick, and let me say my prayers
with you.&#8221; A simple expression of sympathy, but it meant so much
to me at such a time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Doctors Disagree</span></h3>

<p>At half-past eight I was taken to a room adjoining the court, where,
in charge of a female warder and a policeman, I awaited my call. I then
passed into the court, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> two magistrates, Sir William B. Forwood
and Mr. W. S. Barrett, sat officially to hear the evidence. When the
testimony had been given the court adjourned.</p>

<p>When I rose to leave the court, in order to reach the door, I had
to meet face to face well-dressed women spectators at the back, and
the moment I turned around these started hissing me. The presiding
justice immediately shouted to the officer on duty to shut the door,
while the burly figures of several policemen, who moved toward the
hostile spectators, effectually put an end to the outburst. It was amid
such scenes, and this sort of preparation for my ordeal, that on the
following day, the 14th of June, the Magisterial Inquiry was resumed,
and the evidence connected with the charge of murder gone into. On
conclusion of the testimony the magistrates retired, and after a brief
consultation returned into court.</p>

<p>Sir William Forwood: &#8220;Our opinion is that this is a case which
ought to be decided by jury.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"
id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pickford (my counsel): &#8220;If that is clearly the opinion of
the Bench I shall not occupy their time by going into the defense now,
because I understand, whatever defense may be put forward, the Bench
may think it right for a jury to decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chairman: &#8220;Yes, we think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was then ordered to stand up and was formally charged in the usual
manner.</p>

<p>I replied: &#8220;I reserve my defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir William Forwood made answer: &#8220;Florence Elizabeth Maybrick,
it is our duty to commit you to take your trial at the ensuing Assizes
for wilful murder of the late James Maybrick.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was then remanded into custody.</p>

<p>I found it difficult to understand why these magistrates
committed me to trial for murder on that evidence. There was
certainly not sufficient evidence that the cause of death was
arsenic. The doctors could not say so. No arsenic had been found
by the analyst in the stomach, the appearance of which at the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i>, Dr. Humphreys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"
id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> said, was &#8220;consistent&#8221; with
either poisoning or ordinary congestion of the stomach; but, after
examination, a minute quantity of arsenic, certainly not enough to
cause death, was detected in the liver, the appearance of which, Dr.
Humphreys said, showed no evidence of any irritant poison. On this
point Dr. Carter agreed with Dr. Humphreys, &#8220;but in a more
positive manner,&#8221; while Dr. Barron did not exactly agree with Dr.
Carter.</p>

<p>The analyst had found both arsenic and &#8220;traces&#8221; of
arsenic, in some bottles and things which had been found in the house
after death, as to which, where they came from, or who had put them
there, no one had any knowledge. This is the evidence upon which I was
committed. Justice Stephen, in addressing the grand jury, even thus
early showed a predisposition against me, due at this time, no doubt,
to the sensational reports in the press. A true bill was found, and I
was brought to trial before him on the 31st of July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"
id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letters from Walton Jail</span></h3>

<p>The six weeks intervening before my trial were very terrible. The
mental strain was incessant, and I suffered much from insomnia. The
stress and confinement were telling on my health, as was the separation
from my children. I insert here two extracts from letters, written by
me, from Walton Jail. One is to my mother, dated the 21st of July,
1889, a few days before my trial:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I am not feeling very well. This fearful strain and the
necessity for continued self-control is beginning to tell upon me.
But I am not in the least afraid. I shall show composure, dignity and
fortitude to the last.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter I wrote to a friend on
June 27, before my trial on July 31:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have made my peace with God. I have forgiven unreservedly
all those who have ruined and forsaken me. To-morrow I partake of
the Holy Communion with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> clear conscience, and I place my faith in
God&#8217;s mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;God give me strength is my constant prayer. I feel so
lonely&mdash;as if every hand were against me. To think that for three
or four days I must be unveiled before all those uncharitable eyes.
You can not think how awful it appears to me. So far the ordeal has
been all anticipation; then it will be stern reality&mdash;which always
braces the nerves and courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen in the Liverpool <cite>Post</cite> the judge&#8217;s address
on the prosecution to the jury, and it is enough to appal the stoutest
heart. I hear the police are untiring and getting up the case against
me regardless of expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray for me, my friend, for the darkest days of my life are
now to be lived through. I trust in God&#8217;s justice, whatever I may
be in the sight of man.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lord Russell&#8217;s Opinion</span></h3>

<p>I received many visits from my lawyers, the Messrs. Cleaver,
and just before the trial one from my leading counsel, Sir<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> Charles
Russell, later Lord Russell of Killowen, Lord Chief Justice of England.
The following statement made by him relative to this visit may interest
my readers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I will make no public statement of what my personal belief
is as to Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s guilt or innocence, but I will tell
you, who have stood by her all these years, that, perplexed with the
instructions in the brief, I took what was an unusual step: I went to
see her in prison before her trial, and questioned her there to the
best of my ability for the purpose of getting the truth out of her.
During the whole seven days of her trial I made careful observation of
her demeanor, and since her imprisonment I have availed myself of my
judicial right to visit her at Aylesbury Prison; and, making the best
use of such opportunities of arriving at a just conclusion about her
own self-consciousness, I decided in my own mind that it never for a
moment entered her mind to do any bodily injury to her husband. On the
last occasion that I saw her I told her so, as I felt it would and did
give the poor woman some comfort.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Public Condemns Me Unheard</span></h3>

<p>The day preceding my trial found me calm in spirit, and in a measure
prepared for the awful ordeal before me. Up to that time I had shown
a composure that astonished every one. Indeed, some went so far as to
say I was without feeling. Perhaps I was toward their kind. I would
have responded to sympathy, but never to distrust. At that time I was
suspected by all&mdash;or, rather, people were not sufficiently just to
content themselves with suspicions; they condemned me outright, and,
unheard, struck at a weak, defenseless woman; and this upon what is now
generally admitted to have been insufficient evidence to sustain the
indictment.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER TWO<br />

The Trial</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Injustice of Trying the Case at
Liverpool</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">My</span> trial was set for
the 31st of July in St. George&#8217;s Hall, Liverpool. Immediately
after nine o&#8217;clock on that day, the part of the building which
is open to the general public was filled by a well-dressed audience,
including many of my one-time friends. During all the days of my trial,
I am told, Liverpool society fought for tickets. Ladies were attired as
for a matin&eacute;e, and some brought their luncheons that they might
retain their seats. Many of them carried opera-glasses, which they
did not hesitate to level at me. The Earl of Sefton occupied a seat
on the bench with the judge, and among the audience were many public
and city men and judicial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51"
id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> officers. The press had for two months
supplied nourishment in the form of the most sensational stories about
me, to feed the morbid appetite of the public. The excitement ran so
high that the Liverpool crowds even hissed me as I was driven through
the streets. It was a mockery of justice to hold such a trial in such
a place as Liverpool, at such a time, by a common jury; and it was a
mockery of common sense to expect that any Liverpool common jury could,
when they got into the jury-box, dismiss from their minds all they had
heard and seen. In a letter which I wrote to my mother, when in Walton
Jail, on the 28th of June, about a month before the trial, I said:
&#8220;I sincerely hope Messrs. Cleaver will arrange for my trial to
take place in London. I shall receive an impartial verdict there, which
I can not expect from a jury in Liverpool, whose minds will virtually
be made up before any evidence is heard.&#8221; Owing, however, to a
lack of funds this hope was not realized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>I was at this time alone, utterly forsaken, and the only persons to
whom I could look for protection and advice were my lawyers, Messrs.
Cleaver.</p>

<p>At half-past eight on the morning of my trial, a black van was
driven up to the side door, in the fore part of which were already
confined the male prisoners awaiting trial. I was placed in the rear,
a female warder stepped in, the door was shut, and I felt as if I were
already buried. A crowd witnessed my departure from Walton Jail, and
a larger one was assembled outside St. George&#8217;s Hall. But I was
conducted into the building without attracting attention.</p>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock I heard a blast of trumpets that heralded the
judge&#8217;s entrance into court. Shortly after my name was called,
and, accompanied by a male and a female warder, I ascended slowly the
stone staircase from the cells leading to the dock. I was calm and
collected in manner, although aware of the gravity of my position. But
the consciousness of innocence, and a strong<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> faith in Divine support,
made me confident that strength would be given to endure the awful
ordeal before me.</p>

<img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="center noindent">ST. GEORGE&#8217;S HALL, LIVERPOOL,<br />
Where the trial of Mrs Maybrick was held.</p>
</div>

<p>In reply to the Clerk of Arraigns, who read the charge against
me of &#8220;feloniously and wilfully murdering my husband, James
Maybrick,&#8221; I answered &#8220;Not guilty.&#8221; It is customary
in criminal courts in England to compel a prisoner to stand in the
dock during the whole trial, but I was provided with a seat by
recommendation of the prison doctor, as I suffered from attacks of
faintness, though against this humane departure a great public outcry
was raised.</p>

<p>The counsel engaged in the case were Mr. Addison, Q.C., M.P. (now
judge at the Southwark County Court), Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Swift,
for the prosecution; Sir Charles Russell, assisted by Mr. Pickford and
Messrs. Cleaver, for the defense.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Unexpected Verdict</span></h3>

<p>When the trial began there was a strong feeling against me,
but as it proceeded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> the fact was made clear that Mr. Maybrick
had long been addicted to taking large quantities of arsenic, coupled
with the evidence, to quote Sir Charles Russell, (1) that there was no
proof of arsenical poisoning, (2) that there was no proof that arsenic
was administered to him by me, the prejudice against me gradually
changed, until, at the close of the trial, there was a complete
revulsion of sentiment, and my acquittal was confidently expected.</p>

<p>When the jury retired to consider their verdict I was taken below,
and here my solicitor came to speak to me; but the tension of mind was
so great I do not recall one word that he said.</p>

<p>After what seemed to me an age, but was in reality only thirty-eight
minutes, the jury returned into court and took their places in the
jury-box. I was recalled to the dock. When I stood up to hear the
verdict I had an intuition that it was unfavorable. Every one looked
away from me, and there was a stillness in court that could<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> be felt.
Then the Clerk of Arraigns arose and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you agreed upon the verdict, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you find the prisoner guilty of the murder of James
Maybrick or not guilty?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Foreman: &#8220;Guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A prolonged &#8220;Ah!&#8221; strangely like the sighing of wind
through a forest, sounded through the court. I reeled as if struck a
blow and sank upon a chair. The Clerk of Arraigns then turned to me and
said: &#8220;Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, you have been found guilty
of wilful murder. Have you anything to say why the court should not
pronounce sentence upon you according to the law?&#8221;</p>

<p>I arose, and with a prayer for strength, I clasped the rail of
the dock in front of me, and said in a low voice, but with firmness:
&#8220;My lord, everything has been against me; I am not guilty of this
crime.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56"
id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Judge&#8217;s Sentence</span></h3>

<p>These were the last words which the law permitted me to speak.
Mr. Justice Stephen then assumed the full dress of the criminal
judge&mdash;the black cap&mdash;and pronounced the sentence of the
court in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Prisoner at the bar, I am no longer able to treat you as
being innocent of the dreadful crime laid to your charge. You have been
convicted by a jury of this city, after a lengthy and most painful
investigation, followed by a defense which was in every respect worthy
of the man. The jury has convicted you, and the law leaves me no
discretion, and I must pass the sentence of the law:</p>

<p>&#8220;The court doth order you to be taken from hence to the place
from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, and
that you be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and that your body
be afterward buried within the precincts of the prison in which you
shall be confined after your conviction. And may the Lord have mercy
upon your soul!&#8221;</p></div>

Who presided at the trial of Mrs. Maybrick.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Utterly stunned I was removed from the court to Walton Jail, there
to be confined until this sentence of the law should be carried into
effect.</p>

<p>The mob, as the Liverpool public was styled by the press, before
they had heard or read a word of the defense had hissed me when I
entered the court; and now, that they had heard or read the evidence,
cheered me as I drove away in the prison-van, and hissed and hooted the
judge, who with difficulty gained his carriage.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">In the Shadow of Death</span></h3>

<p>In all the larger local English prisons there is one room, swept
and ready, the sight of which can not fail to stir unwonted thoughts.
The room is large, with barred windows, and contains only a bed
and a chair. It is the last shelter of those whom the law declares
to have forfeited their lives. Near by is a small brick building
in the prison-yard, that has apparently<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> nothing to connect it with
the room; yet they are joined by a sinister suggestion.</p>

<p>For nearly three terrible weeks I was confined in this cell of the
condemned, to taste the bitterness of death under its most appalling
and shameful aspect. I was carefully guarded by two female warders, who
would gladly have been spared the task. They might not read nor sleep;
at my meals, through my prayers, during every moment of agony, they
still watched on and rarely spoke. Many have asked me what my feelings
were at that awful time. I remember little in the way of details
as to my state of mind. I was too overwhelmed for either analytic
or collective thought. Conscious of my innocence, I had no fear of
physical death, for the love of my Heavenly Father was so enveloping
that death seemed to me a blessed escape from a world in which such an
unspeakable travesty of justice could take place; while I petitioned
for a reconsideration of the verdict,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> it was wholly for the sake
of my mother and my children.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of any public efforts for my relief. I was held fast
on the wheels of a slow-moving machine, hypnotized by the striking
hours and the flight of my numbered minutes, with the gallows staring
me in the face. The date of my execution was not told me at Walton
Jail, but I heard afterward that it was to have taken place on the 26th
of August. On the 22d, while I was taking my daily exercise in the
yard attached to the condemned cell, the governor, Captain Anderson,
accompanied by the chief matron, entered. He called me to him, and,
with a voice which&mdash;all honor to him&mdash;trembled with emotion,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybrick, no commutation of sentence has come down to-day,
and I consider it my duty to tell you to prepare for death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, governor,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;my conscience
is clear. God&#8217;s will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Commutation of Sentence</span></h3>

<p>He then walked away and I returned to my cell. The female warder
was weeping silently, but I was calm and spent the early part of the
night in my usual prayers. About midnight exhausted nature could bear
no more, and I fainted. I had barely regained consciousness when
I heard the shuffle of feet outside, the click of the key in the
lock&mdash;that warning catch in the slow machinery of my doom. I
sprang up, and with one supreme effort of will braced myself for what
I believed was the last act of my life. The governor and a chaplain
entered, followed by a warder. They read my expectation in my face,
and the governor, hastening forward, exclaimed in an agitated voice:
&#8220;It is well; it is good news!&#8221; When I opened my eyes once
more I was lying in bed in the hospital, and I remained there until I
was taken to Woking Convict Prison.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER THREE<br />

In Solitary Confinement</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Removal to Woking Prison</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the
29th of August I was hastily awakened by a female warder, who said that
orders had come down from the Home Office for my removal that day to a
convict prison.</p>

<p>When I left, the governor was standing at the gate, and, with a
kindliness of voice which I deeply appreciated, told me to be brave and
good.</p>

<p>A crowd was in waiting at the station. I was roughly hustled through
it into a third-class carriage.</p>

<p>The only ray of light that penetrated those dark hours of
my journey came from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>an American woman. God bless her, whoever
she is or wherever she is! At every station that the train stopped
she got out and came to the carriage door and spoke words of sympathy
and comfort. She was the first of my countrywomen to voice to me the
protest that swelled into greater volume as the years rolled by.</p>

<p>As the train drew up at Woking station a crowd assembled. Outside
stood a cab, to which I was at once conducted, and we drove through
lovely woods; the scent of flowers was wafted by the breeze into what
seemed to be a hearse that was bearing me on toward my living tomb.</p>

<p>As we approached the prison the great iron gate swung wide, and
the cab drove silently into the yard. There I descended. The governor
gave an order, and a woman&mdash;who I afterward found was assistant
superintendent&mdash;came forward. Accompanied by her and an officer, I
was led across a near-by yard to a building which stood somewhat apart
from the others and is known as the infirmary. There a principal<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> matron
received me, and the assistant superintendent and the chief matron
returned to their quarters.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Convict Uniform</span></h3>

<p>In the grasp of what seemed to me a horrible nightmare, I found
myself in a cell with barred windows, a bed, and a chair. Without,
the stillness of death reigned. I remained there perhaps half an hour
when the door opened and I was commanded by a female warder to follow
her. In a daze I obeyed mechanically. We crossed the same yard again
and entered a door that led into a room containing only a fireplace, a
table, and a bath. Here I was told to take off my clothes, as those I
had traveled in had to be sent back to the prison at Liverpool, where
they belonged.</p>

<p>When I was dressed in the uniform to which the greatest
stigma and disgrace is attached, I was told to sit down. The
warder then stepped quickly forward, and with a pair of scissors
cut off my hair to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> nape of my neck. This act seemed, above
all others, to bring me to a sense of my degradation, my utter
helplessness; and the iron of the awful tragedy, of which I was the
innocent victim, entered my soul. I was then weighed and my height
taken. My weight was one hundred and twelve pounds, and my height five
feet three inches.</p>

<p>Once more I was bidden to follow my guide. We recrossed the yard and
entered the infirmary. Here I was locked in the cell already mentioned.
At last I could be alone after the anguish and torture of the day. I
prayed for sleep that I might lose consciousness of my intolerable
anguish. But sleep, that gentle nurse of the sad and suffering, came
not. What a night! I shudder even now at the memory of it. Physically
exhausted, smarting with the thought of the cruel, heartless way in
which I had been beaten down and trodden under foot, I felt that
mortal death would have been more merciful than the living death<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> to which
I was condemned. In the adjoining cell an insane woman was raving and
weeping throughout the night, and I wondered whether in the years to
come I should become like her.</p>

<p>The next day I was visited by the governor on his official rounds.
Then the doctor came and made a medical examination, and ordered me
to be detained in the infirmary until further orders. My mind is a
blank as to what happened for some time afterward. My next remembrance
is being told by a coarse-looking, harsh-spoken female warder to get
ready to go into the prison. Once more I was led across the big yard,
and then I stood within the walls that were to be for years my tomb.
Outside the sun was shining and the birds were singing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">In Solitary Confinement</span></h3>

<p>Without, picture a vast outline of frowning masonry. Within,
when I had passed the double outer gates and had been locked<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> out and
locked in in succession, I found myself in a central hall, from which
ran cage-like galleries divided into tiers and landings, with a row
of small cells on either side. The floors are of stone, the landings
of slate, the railings of steel, and the stairs of iron. Wire netting
is stretched over the lowest tier to prevent prisoners from throwing
themselves over in one of those frenzies of rage and despair of which
every prison has its record. Within their walls can be found, above all
places, that most degrading, heart-breaking product of civilization,
a human automaton. All will, all initiative, all individuality, all
friendship, all the things that make human beings attractive to one
another, are absent. Suffering there is dumb, and when it goes beyond
endurance&mdash;alas!</p>

<p>I followed the warder to a door, perhaps not more than two
feet in width. She unlocked it and said, &#8220;Pass in.&#8221;
I stepped forward, but started back in horror. Through the open
door I saw, by the dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67"
id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> light of a small window that was never
cleaned, a cell seven feet by four.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t put me in there!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I can
not bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer the warder took me roughly by the shoulder, gave me a
push, and shut the door. There was nothing to sit upon but the cold
slate floor. I sank to my knees. I felt suffocated. It seemed that the
walls were drawing nearer and nearer together, and presently the life
would be crushed out of me. I sprang to my feet and beat wildly with my
hands against the door. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake let me out! Let me
out!&#8221; But my voice could not penetrate that massive barrier, and
exhausted I sank once more to the floor. I can not recall those nine
months of solitary confinement without a feeling of horror. My cell
contained only a hammock rolled up in a corner, and three shelves let
into the wall&mdash;no table nor stool. For a seat I was compelled to
place my bedclothes on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Daily Routine</span></h3>

<p>No one can realize the horror of solitary confinement who has
not experienced it. Here is one day&#8217;s routine: It is six
o&#8217;clock; I arise and dress in the dark; I put up my hammock and
wait for breakfast. I hear the ward officer in the gallery outside. I
take a tin plate and a tin mug in my hands and stand before the cell
door. Presently the door opens; a brown, whole-meal, six-ounce loaf is
placed upon the plate; the tin mug is taken, and three-quarters of a
pint of gruel is measured in my presence, when the mug is handed back
in silence, and the door is closed and locked. After I have taken a
few mouthfuls of bread I begin to scrub my cell. A bell rings and my
door is again unlocked. No word is spoken, because I know exactly what
to do. I leave my cell and fall into single file, three paces in the
rear of my nearest fellow convict. All of us are alike in knowing what
we have to do, and we march away silently<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> to Divine service. We are
criminals under punishment, and our keepers march us like dumb cattle
to the worship of God. To me the twenty minutes of its duration were as
an oasis in a weary desert. When it came to an end I felt comforted,
and always a little more resigned to my fate. Chapel over, I returned
directly to my cell, for I was in solitary confinement, and might not
enjoy the privilege of working in company with my prison companions.</p>

<p>Work I must, but I must work alone. Needlework and knitting fall
to my lot. My task for the day is handed to me, and I sit in my cell
plying my needle, with the consciousness that I must not indulge in an
idle moment, for an unaccomplished task means loss of marks, and loss
of marks means loss of letters and visits. As chapel begins at 8:30
I am back in my cell soon after nine, and the requirement is that I
shall make one shirt a day&mdash;certainly not less than five shirts a
week. If I am obstinate or indolent, I shall be reported by the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> ward
officer, and be brought to book with punishment&mdash;perhaps reduced
to a diet of bread and water and total confinement in my cell for
twenty-four hours. If I am faint, weak, or unwell, I may be excused
the full performance of my task; but there must be no doubt of my
inability. In such case it is for me to have my name entered for the
prison doctor, and obtain from him the indulgence that will remit a
portion of my prescribed work to three or four shirts.</p>

<p>However, as I am well, I work automatically, closely, and with
persistence. Then comes ten o&#8217;clock, and with it the governor
with his escort. He inspects each cell, and if all is not as it should
be, the prisoner will hear of it. There is no friendly greeting of
&#8220;Good-morning&#8221; nor parting &#8220;Good-night&#8221;
within those gloomy walls. The tone is formal and the governor
says: &#8220;How are you, Maybrick? Any complaints? Do you want
anything?&#8221; and then he passes on. Then I am again alone with my
work and my brooding thoughts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> I never made complaints. One but adds to
one&#8217;s burden by finding causes for complaint. With the coming and
the going of the governor the monotony returns to stagnation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Exercise Hour</span></h3>

<p>Presently, however, the prison bell rings again. I know what the
clangor means, and mechanically lay down my work. It is the hour
for exercise, and I put on my bonnet and cape. One by one the cell
doors of the ward are opened. One by one we come out from our cells
and fall into single file. Then, with a ward officer in charge, we
march into the exercise yard. We have drawn up in line, three paces
apart, and this is the form in which we tramp around the yard and
take our exercise. This yard is perhaps forty feet square, and there
are thirty-five of us to expand in its &#8220;freedom.&#8221; The
inclosure is oppressively repulsive. Stone-flagged, hemmed within
ugly walls, it gives one a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72"
id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> hideous feeling of compression. It seems
more like a bear-pit than an airing ground for human beings. But I
forget that we are not here to have things made easy, comfortable, and
pleasant for us. We are here to be punished, to be scourged for our
crimes and misdeeds. Can you wonder that human nature sometimes revolts
and dares even prison rigor? Human instincts may be suppressed, but not
wholly crushed.</p>

<p>There were at Woking two yards in which flowers and green trees were
visible, but it was only in after years that I was permitted to take my
exercise in these yards, and then only half an hour on Sunday.</p>

<p>When the one hour for exercise is over, in a file as before, we
tramp back to our work. Confined as we are for twenty-two hours in
our narrow, gloomy cells, the exercise, dull as it is, is our only
opportunity for a glimpse of the sky and for a taste of outdoor life,
and affords our only relief from an otherwise almost unbearable
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"
id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Midday Meal</span></h3>

<p>At noon the midday meal. The first sign of its approach is the
sound of the fatigue party of prisoners bringing the food from the
kitchen into the ward. I hear the ward officer passing with the weary
group from cell to cell, and presently she will reach my door. My
food is handed to me, then the door is closed and double locked. In
the following two hours, having finished my meal, I can work or read.
At two o&#8217;clock the fatigue party again goes on its mechanical
round; the cell door is again unlocked, this time for the collection
of dinner-cans. The meal of each prisoner is served out by weight, and
the law allows her to claim her full quantity to the uttermost fraction
of an ounce. She is even entitled to see it weighed if she fancies
it falls short. Work is then resumed until five o&#8217;clock, when
gruel and bread is again served, as at breakfast, with half an hour
for its disposal. From that time on until<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> seven o&#8217;clock more
work, when again is heard the clang of the prison bell, and with it
comes the end of our monotonous day. I take down my hammock, and once
more await the opening of the door. We have learned exactly what to do.
With the opening of our cells we go forward, and each places her broom
outside the door. So shall it be known that we each have been visited
in our cells before the locking of our doors and gates for the night.
If any of us are taking medicine by the doctor&#8217;s orders we now
receive it. On through the ten long, weary hours of the night the night
officers patrol the wards, keeping watch, and through a glass peep-hole
silently inspect us in our beds to see that nothing is amiss.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Cruelty of Solitary Confinement</span></h3>

<p>Solitary confinement is by far the most cruel feature of
English penal servitude. It inflicts upon the prisoner at
the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> of her sentence, when most sensitive to
the horrors which prison punishment entails, the voiceless solitude,
the hopeless monotony, the long vista of to-morrow, to-morrow,
to-morrow stretching before her, all filled with desolation and
despair. Once a prisoner has crossed the threshold of a convict prison,
not only is she dead to the world, but she is expected in word and deed
to lose or forget every vestige of her personality. Verily,</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER FOUR<br />

The Period of Probation</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Change of Cell</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> day I had completed
the nine months of solitary confinement I entered upon a new stage,
that of probation for nine months. I was taken from Hall G to Hall A.
There were in Woking seven halls, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, separated by
two barred doors and a narrow passage. Every hall has three wards. The
female warder who accompanied me locked me in my cell. I looked around
with a sense of intense relief. The cell was as large again as the one
I had left. The floor was of wood instead of slate. It contained a camp
bedstead on which was placed a so-called mattress, consisting of a
sack the length of the bed, stuffed with coir, the fiber of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> coconut.
There were also provided two coarse sheets, two blankets, and a red
counterpane. In a corner were three iron shelves let in the wall one
above the other. On the top shelf was folded a cape, and on top of this
there was a small, coarse straw bonnet. The second shelf contained a
tin cup, a tin plate, a wooden spoon, and a salt-cellar. The third
shelf was given up to a slate, on which might be written complaints or
requests to the governor; it is a punishable offense in prison to write
with a pencil or on any paper not provided.</p>

<p>There was also a Bible, a prayer-book and hymn-book, and a book from
the library. Near the door stood a log of wood upright, fastened to
the floor, and this was the only seat in the cell. It was immovable,
and so placed that the prisoner might always be in view of the warder.
Near it, let into the wall, was a piece of deal board, which answered
for a table. Through an almost opaque piece of square glass light
glimmered from the hall, the only means of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> lighting the cell at night;
facing this, high up, was a barred window admitting light from the
outside.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Evils of the Silent System</span></h3>

<p>The routine of my daily life was the same as during &#8220;solitary
confinement.&#8221; The cell door may be open, but its outer covering
or gate is locked, and, although I knew there was a human creature
separated from me only by a cell wall and another gate, not a whisper
might I breathe. There is no rule of prison discipline so productive
of trouble and disaster as the &#8220;silent system,&#8221; and
the tyrannous and rigorous method with which it is enforced is the
cause of two-thirds of all the misconduct and disturbance that
occurs in prison. The silence rule gives supreme gratification to
the tyrannous officer, for on the slightest pretext she can report a
woman for talking&mdash;a turn of the head, a movement of the lips
is enough of an excuse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> a report. And there is heavy punishment
that can be inflicted for this offense, both in the male and female
prisons. An offender may be consigned to solitary confinement,
put for three days on bread and water, or suffer the loss of a
week&#8217;s remission, which means a week added to her term of
imprisonment&mdash;and all this for incautiously uttering a word.</p>

<p>Unless it be specifically intended as a means of torture, the
system of solitary confinement, even for four months, the term to
which it has since been reduced, can meet only with condemnation.
I am convinced that, within limits, the right of speech and the
interchange of thought, at least for two hours daily, even during
probation, would insure better discipline than perpetual silence,
which can be enforced only by a complete suppression of nature, and
must result in consequent weakness of mind and ruin of temper. During
the first months of her sentence a prisoner is more frequently in
trouble for breach of this one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"
id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> rule than from all other causes. The
reduction of the term of probation from nine to four months has been
followed by a reduction in mental afflictions, which is proof that
nothing wholesome or good can have its growth in unnatural solitude.</p>

<p>The silent system has a weakening effect upon the memory. A prisoner
often finds difficulty in deciding upon the pronunciation of words
which she has not heard for a considerable period. I often found
myself, when desirous of using unusual words, especially in French or
German, pronouncing them to myself in order to fix the pronunciation
in my memory. It is well to bear in mind what a small number of words
the prisoner has an opportunity of using in the monotony of prison
life. The same inquiries are made day after day, and the same responses
given. A vocabulary of one hundred words will include all that a
prisoner habitually uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81"
id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Insanity and Nervous Breakdown of
Prisoners</span></h3>

<p>No defender of the silent system pretends that it wholly succeeds
in preventing speech among prisoners. But be that as it may, a period
of four months&#8217; solitary confinement in the case of a female,
and six months&#8217; in the case of a male, and especially of a girl
or youth, is surely a crime against civilization and humanity. Such
a punishment is inexpressible torture to both mind and body. I speak
from experience. The torture of continually enforced silence is known
to produce insanity or nervous breakdown more than any other feature
connected with prison discipline. Since the passing of the Act of 1898,
mitigating this form of punishment, much good has been accomplished,
as is proved by the diminution of insanity in prison life, the
decreasing scale of prison punishment, and the lessening of the
death-rate. By still further reducing this barbarous practise,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> or,
better, by abolishing it entirely, corresponding happy results may
confidently be expected. The more the prisoners are placed under
conditions and amid surroundings calculated to develop a better life,
the greater is the hope that the system will prove curative; but so
long as prisoners are subjected to conditions which have a hardening
effect at the very beginning of their prison life, there is little
chance of ultimate reformation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Need of Separate Confinement for the
Weak-Minded</span></h3>

<p>There are many women who hover about the borderland of insanity
for months, possibly for years. They are recognized as weak-minded,
and consequently they make capital out of their condition, and
by the working of their distorted minds, and petty tempers, and
unreasonable jealousy, add immeasurably not only to the ghastliness of
the &#8220;house of sorrow,&#8221; but are a sad clog on the efforts
to self-betterment of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> level-minded sisters in misery. Of
these many try hard to make the best of what has to be gone through.
Therefore, is it necessary, is it wise, is it right that such a state
of things should be allowed? The weak-minded should be kept in a
separate place, with their own officers to attend them. Neither the
weak-minded, the epileptic, nor the consumptives were isolated. There
is great need of reform wherever this is the case. Prisoners whose
behavior is different from the normal should be separated from the
other prisoners, and made to serve out their sentences under specially
adapted conditions.</p>

<p>I read in the newspapers that insanity is on the increase; this
fact is clearly reflected within the prison walls. It is stated that
the insane form about three per thousand of the general population.
In local English prisons insanity, it is said, even after deducting
those who come in insane, is seven times more prevalent than among the
general population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reading an Insufficient Relaxation</span></h3>

<p>The nervous crises do not now supervene so frequently as formerly
in the case of prisoners of a brooding disposition, but the fact
remains that, in spite of the slight amelioration, mental light
is still excluded&mdash;that communion on which rests all human
well-being. The vacuity of the solitary system, to some at least, is
partially lighted by books. But what of those who can not read, or
who have not sufficient concentration of mind to profit by reading
as a relaxation? There are many such, in spite of the high standard
of free education that prevails at the present day. The shock of the
trial, and the uprooting of a woman&#8217;s domestic ties, coupled with
the additional mental strain of having to start her prison career in
solitary confinement, is surely neither humane, nor merciful, nor wise.
These months of solitary confinement leave an ineffaceable mark. It is
during the first lonely months that the seeds<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> of bitterness and
hardness of heart are sown, and it requires more than a passive
resistance&mdash;nay, nothing short of an unfaltering faith and trust
in an overruling Providence&mdash;to bring a prisoner safely through
the ordeal. Let the sympathetic reader try to realize what it means
never to feel the touch of anything soft or warm, never to see anything
that is attractive&mdash;nothing but stone above, around, and beneath.
The deadly chill creeps into one&#8217;s bones; the bitter days of
winter and the still bitterer nights were torture, for Woking Prison
was not heated. My hands and feet were covered with chilblains.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Sufferings from Cold and Insomnia</span></h3>

<p>Oh, the horrors of insomnia! If one could only forget one&#8217;s
sufferings in sleep! During all the fifteen years of my imprisonment,
insomnia was (and, alas! is still) my constant companion. Little
wonder! I might fall asleep, when suddenly the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> whole prison is awakened
by shriek upon shriek, rending the stillness of the night. I am
now, perforce, fully awake. Into my ears go tearing all the shrill
execrations and blasphemies, all the hideous uproars of an inferno,
compounded of bangs, shrieks, and general demoniac ragings. The wild
smashing of glass startles the halls. I lie in my darkened cell with
palpitating heart. Like a savage beast, the woman of turmoil has torn
her clothing and bedding into shreds, and now she is destroying all
she can lay hands on. The ward officers are rushing about in slippered
feet, the bell rings summoning the warders, who are always needed when
such outbursts occur, and the woman, probably in a strait-jacket, is
borne to the penal cells. Then stillness returns to the ghastly place,
and with quivering nerves I may sleep&mdash;if I can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Attendance</span></h3>

<p>But what if one is ill in the night? The lonely prisoner in her cell
may summon aid by ringing the bell. The moment it is set in motion it
causes a black iron slab to project from the outer wall of her cell in
the gallery. On the slab is the prisoner&#8217;s number, and the ward
officer, hearing the bell, at once looks for the cell from which the
call has been sent. Presently she finds it, then fetches the principal
matron, and together they enter the hard, unhomelike place. If the
prisoner is ill they call the doctor of the prison, and medicines and
aid will be given. But sympathy is no part of their official duty, and
be the warder never so tender in her own domestic circle, tenderness
must not be shown toward a prisoner. The patient may be removed from
her cell to the infirmary, where they will care for her medically,
perhaps as well as they would in a hospital; she may even receive a
few flowers from an infirmary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"
id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> warder whose heart comes out from its
official shell; but through it all, sick though she be, she is still a
prisoner under lock and key, a woman under surveillance, a woman denied
communion with her kind.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Added Sufferings of the Delicately
Nurtured</span></h3>

<p>What words can adequately describe the long years, blank and weary
enough for all prisoners, but which are indescribably so to one who
has been delicately nurtured! I had enjoyed the refinements of social
life; I had pitied, and tried, as far as lay in my power, to help the
poor and afflicted, but I had never known anything of the barbarism,
the sordid vices of low life. And I was condemned to drag out existence
amid such surroundings, because twelve ignorant men had taken upon
themselves to decide a question which neither the incompetent judge nor
the medical witnesses could themselves determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"
id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as I can learn, there is no other instance of a woman
undoubtedly innocent and of gentle birth, confined for a term of nearly
fifteen years in an English convict prison. In the nature of things a
delicate woman feels more acutely than a robust prisoner the rigors of
prolonged captivity.</p>

<p>Neither confidence nor respect can be secured when punishment is
excessive, for it then becomes an act of persecution, suitable only
for ages of darkness. The supineness of Parliament in not establishing
a court of criminal appeal fastens a dark blot upon the judicature of
England, and is inconsistent with the innate love of justice and fair
play of its people.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How Criminals and Imbeciles are Made</span></h3>

<p>The law in prison is the same for the rich as the poor, the
&#8220;Star Class&#8221; as for the ignorant, brutalized criminal.
My register was &#8220;L. P. 29.&#8221; These letters and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> numbers
were worked in white cotton upon a piece of black cloth. Your sentence
is indicated thus: &#8220;L&#8221; stands for penal servitude for
life; &#8220;P&#8221; for the year of conviction, which in my case
was the sixteenth year since the previous lettering. This is done
every twenty-five years. The &#8220;29&#8221; meant that I was the
twenty-ninth convict of my year, 1889. In addition to this register I
wore a red cloth star placed above it. The &#8220;Star Class,&#8221;
of which I was a member, consisted of women who have been convicted of
one crime only, committed in a moment of weakness or despair, or under
pressure which they were not strong enough to resist at the time, such
as infanticide, forgery, incendiarism; and who, having been educated
and respectably brought up, betray otherwise no criminal instincts
or inclinations; and who, when in the world, would be distinct in
character from the habitual criminal, not only from a social point of
view, but in their virtues, faults, and crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"
id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>There should be separate rules and privileges to meet the case
of a prisoner guilty of moral lapses only, as distinguished from
the habitual breaker of the laws. At present the former gets the
same treatment and discipline as the habitual criminal of several
convictions, and can not claim a single privilege that the old
offender has not a right to ask&mdash;for example, members of both
classes are limited to the same number of letters and visits. The
&#8220;Star Class&#8221; is supposed to be kept separate from ordinary
prisoners. It was so at Woking Prison. But at Aylesbury Prison, to
which I was transferred later, they were sandwiched between two wards
of habitual criminals, with whom they came continually in contact,
not only in passing to and from the workshops, fetching meals, and
going to exercise, but continuously. That contamination should ensue
is hardly surprising. It requires a will of iron, and nearly the
spirit of a saint, not to be corrupted by the sights and sounds of
a prison, even when no word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> is spoken. It is a serious accusation
against any system to say &#8220;that it produces the thing it is
designed to prevent,&#8221; but such, I am convinced, is the fact as
regards the manufacture of criminals and imbeciles by the present
system of penalism almost the world over.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER FIVE<br />

The Period of Hard Labor</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Routine</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> passed solitary
confinement and probation, I entered upon the third stage, hard labor,
when I was permitted to leave my cell to assist in carrying meals from
the kitchen, and to sit at my door and converse with the prisoners
in the adjoining cells for two hours daily&mdash;but always in the
presence of an officer who controls and limits the conversation. My
daily routine was now also somewhat different from that of solitary
confinement and probation.</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock the bell rings to rise. Half an hour later
a second bell signifies to the officers that it is time to come
on duty. Each warder in charge of certain wards&mdash;there<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> are
three wards to each hall&mdash;then goes to the chief matron&#8217;s
office, where she receives a key wherewith to unlock the
prisoners&#8217; cells. All keys are given up by the female warder
before going off duty, and locked for the night in an iron safe
under the charge of a male warder. When again in possession of her
key she repairs to her ward, and at the order, &#8220;Unlock,&#8221;
she lets out the prisoners to empty their slops. This done, they are
once more locked in, with the exception of three women who go down to
the kitchen to fetch the cans of tea and loaves of bread which make
up the prisoners&#8217; breakfast. At Woking the breakfast was of
cocoa and coarse meal bread, while later, at Aylesbury, it consisted
of tea and white bread. I am constrained to remark here that more
consideration should be shown by the medical officer toward women who
complain of being physically unfit to do heavy lifting and carrying.
The can is carried by two women up two or three flights of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> stairs,
according to the location of their ward, and the bread by one woman
only. Each can contains fourteen quarts of tea, and the bread-basket
holds thirty pounds or more of bread. To a woman with strong muscles
it may cause no distress, but in the case of myself and others equally
frail, the physical strain was far beyond our strength, and left us
utterly exhausted after the task.</p>

<p>The breakfast was served at seven o&#8217;clock, when the officers
returned to the mess-room to take theirs. At 7:30 a bell rang again,
and the officers returned to their respective wards. At ten minutes to
eight the order was given, &#8220;Unlock.&#8221; Once more the doors
were opened. Then followed the order, &#8220;Chapel,&#8221; and each
woman stood at her door with Bible, prayer-book, and hymn-book in hand.
At the words &#8220;Pass on,&#8221; they file one behind the other
into the chapel, where a warder from each ward sits with her back to
the altar that she may be able the better to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> watch those under her
charge and see that they do not speak. After a service of twenty
minutes the prisoners file back to their cells, place their books on
the lower shelf, and with a drab cape and a white straw hat stand in
readiness for the next order, &#8220;To your doors.&#8221; This given,
they descend into the hall and pass out to their respective places of
work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Talk with the Chaplain</span></h3>

<p>Many of these women have their tender, spiritual moments. At such
times they will beg for a favorite hymn to be sung at the chapel
service on Sunday, and their requests are generally granted by the
chaplain. He is the only friend of the prisoner, and his work is
arduous and often thankless. He is the only one within the walls to
whom she may turn for sympathy and advice. It may not be every woman
who gladly avails herself of the enforced privilege of attending daily
chapel. &#8220;Religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"
id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8221; as a term, is unpalatable to many.
But there are very few who are not better and happier for the few
moments&#8217; unofficial talk with her chaplain, be she Protestant or
Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that his authority is so limited, and his
opportunities for brightening the lives of those who walk in dark
places so few. Red tape and standing orders confront him at every
turn, so that even the religious training is drawn and sucked beneath
the mighty wheel of the Penal Code, and there is no time for personal
suasion to play more than a minor part in a convict&#8217;s life.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Work in the Kitchen</span></h3>

<p>The work for first offenders, who are called the &#8220;Star
Class,&#8221; consists of labor in the kitchen, the mess, and the
officers&#8217; quarters. Six months after I entered upon the third
stage I was put to work in the kitchen. My duties were as follows:
To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wash ten cans, each holding four quarts; to scrub one table, twenty
feet in length; two dressers, twelve feet in length; to wash five
hundred dinner-tins; to clean knives; to wash a sack of potatoes; to
assist in serving the dinners, and to scrub a piece of floor twenty by
ten feet. Besides myself there were eight other women on hard labor in
the kitchen. Our day commenced at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
and continued until 5:30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> A half hour
at breakfast time, twenty minutes at chapel, one hour and a half after
the midday meal, and half an hour after tea summed up our leisure. The
work was hard and rough. The combined heat of the coppers, the stove,
and the steamers was overpowering, especially on hot summer days; but
I struggled on, doing this work preferably to some other, because
the kitchen was the only place where the monotony of prison life was
broken. It was the &#8220;show place,&#8221; and all visitors looked in
to see the food.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Visitors to the Kitchen</span></h3>

<p>During the four years I worked in the kitchen I saw many people. The
Duke of Connaught, Sir Evelyn Wood and his staff, Lord Alverston, Sir
Edward du Cane, the late Lord Rothschild, and Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise,
besides judges, magistrates, authors, philanthropists and others<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> of
an inquiring turn of mind, who had obtained the necessary permit to
make the tour of the prison under the escort of the governor or one or
two of his satellites. These ladies and gentlemen expressed the most
varied and sometimes startling opinions. I recollect on one occasion,
when some visitors happened to be inspecting the kitchen during the
dishing up of the hospital patients&#8217; dinner, one old gentleman
of the party was quite scandalized at the sight of a juicy mutton-chop
and a tempting milk pudding. He expostulated in such a way that the
governor hastened to explain that it was not the ordinary prison diet,
but was intended for a very sick woman. Even then this old gentleman
was not satisfied, and stalked out, audibly grumbling about people
living on the fat of the land and getting a better dinner than he
did. I firmly believe that he left the prison under the impression
that its inmates lived like pampered gourmets, and that he no longer
marveled there were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> many criminals when they were fed on
such luxuries.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;Homelike&#8221; Cell</span></h3>

<p>On another occasion a benevolent-looking old lady, having given
everything and everybody as minute an inspection as was possible,
expressed herself as being charmed, remarking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is so nice and homelike!&#8221;</p>

<p>I have often wondered what that good lady&#8217;s home was like.</p>

<p>A little philosophy is useful, a saving grace, even in prison; but
people have such different ways of expressing sympathy. A visitor,
who I have no doubt intended to be sympathetic, noticing the letter
&#8220;L&#8221; on my arm, inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;How long a time have you to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just completed ten years,&#8221; was my reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; cheerfully responded the sympathetic one,
&#8220;you have done half your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"
id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> time, haven&#8217;t you? The remaining
ten years will soon slip by&#8221;; and the visitor passed on,
blissfully ignorant of the sword she had unwittingly thrust into my
aching heart. Even if a prisoner has little or no hope of a mitigation,
it is not pleasant to have an old wound ruthlessly handled, and ten
years&#8217; imprisonment as lightly spoken of as ten days might be.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Opiate of Acquiescence</span></h3>

<p>I preferred the kitchen work, although often beyond my strength,
to any other that fell to a prisoner&#8217;s lot, because of the
glimpses into the outside world it occasionally afforded. But I never
permitted myself to dwell upon the fact that at one time I had been the
social equal of at least the majority of those with whom I thus came
into passing contact, since to do so would have made my position by
contrast so unbearable that it would have unfitted me to do the work
in a spirit of submission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> not to speak of the mental suffering
which awakened memories would have occasioned. I soon found that both
my spiritual and my mental salvation, under the repressive rules in
force, depended upon unresisting acquiescence&mdash;the keeping of
my sensibilities dulled as near as possible to the level of the mere
animal state which the Penal Code, whether intentionally or otherwise,
inevitably brings about.</p>

<p>I have been frequently asked by friends, since my release, how I
could possibly have endured the shut-in life under such soul-depressing
influences. I have given here and there in my narrative indications
of my feelings under different circumstances. Here I may state in
general that I early found that thoughts of without and thoughts of
within&mdash;those that haunted me of the world and those that were
ever present in my surroundings&mdash;would not march together. I had
to keep step with either the one or the other. The conflict between
the two soon became unbearable, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> compelled to make
choice: whether I would live in the past and as much as possible
exclude the prison, and take the punishment which would inevitably
follow&mdash;as it had in so many cases&mdash;in an unbalanced mind; or
would shut the past out altogether and coerce my thoughts within the
limitations of the prison regulations. My safety lay, as I found, in
compressing my thoughts to the smallest compass of mental existence,
and no sooner did worldly visions or memories intrude themselves,
as they necessarily would, than I immediately and resolutely shut
them out as one draws the blind to exclude the light. While I thus
suppressed all emotions belonging to a natural life, I nevertheless
found, whenever I came accidentally in contact with visitors from the
outside world, that my inner nature was attuned like the strings of a
harp to the least vibration of others&#8217; emotions. The slightest
unconscious inflection of the voice, whether sympathetic or otherwise,
would call forth either a grateful response<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> or an instant withdrawal
into the armor of reserve which I had to adopt for my self-protection.
But this exclusion of the world created a dark background which served
only to intensify the light that shone upon me from realms unseen
of mortal eyes. Lonely I was, yet I was never alone. But, however
satisfying the spiritual communion, the human heart is so constituted
that it needs must yearn for love and sympathy from its own kind, for
recognition of all that is best in us, by something that is like unto
it, in its experiences, feelings, emotions, and aspirations.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Visits of Prisoners&#8217; Friends</span></h3>

<p>A prisoner is allowed to receive a visit from her friends at
intervals of six, four, and two months, according to her stage
of service. There are four stages, each of nine months&#8217;
duration: first, solitary confinement; second, probation; while the
third and fourth stages are not specially<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> designated. During
the first two stages the prisoner is clothed in brown, at the third
stage in green, and the fourth in navy blue. Every article worn by the
prisoner or in use by her is stamped with a &#8220;broad arrow,&#8221;
the convict&#8217;s crest.</p>

<p>A visit may be forfeited by bad conduct or delayed through a loss of
marks. When a prisoner is entitled to receive a visitor, she applies
to the governor for permission to have the permit sent to the person
she names; but if the police report concerning the designated visitor
is unfavorable the request is not granted. When a prisoner&#8217;s
friends&mdash;three being the maximum&mdash;arrive at the prison gates
they ring a bell. The gatekeeper views them through a grille and
inquires their business. They show their permit; whereupon he notifies
the chief matron, who in turn notifies the officer in charge of the
prisoner.</p>

<p>The rule regarding visits precluded any discussion of prison
affairs, or anything regarding treatment, or aught that passes<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
within the prison walls. Had I permitted myself to break this rule
the visit would have been stopped at once by the matron in charge.
Consequently, all the statements on such matters reported from time to
time in the press during my imprisonment, and quoted as received from
my mother or friends, are shown to be pure fabrications.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Mother&#8217;s Visits</span></h3>

<p>A visit! What joy or what sorrow those words express in the outside
world! But in prison&mdash;the pain of it is so great that it can
hardly be borne.</p>

<p>Whenever my mother&#8217;s visit was announced, accompanied by a
matron I passed into a small, oblong room. There a grilled screen
confronted me; a yard or two beyond was a second barrier identical
in structure, and behind it I could see the form of my mother, and
sitting in the space between the grilles, thus additionally separating
us, was a prison matron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> No kiss; not even a clasp of the hand;
no privacy sacred to mother and daughter; not a whisper could pass
between us. Was not this the very depth of humiliation?</p>

<p>My mother crossed every two months from France to visit me. Neither
heat nor cold deterred her from taking this fatiguing journey. Thus
again and again she traveled a hundred miles for love of me, to cheer,
comfort, and console; a hundred miles for thirty minutes!</p>

<p>At these visits she would tell me as best she could of the noble,
unwearied efforts of my countrymen and countrywomen in my cause; of
the sympathy and support of my own Government; of the earnest efforts
of the different American ambassadors in my behalf. And though their
efforts proved all in vain, the knowledge of their belief in my
innocence, and of their sympathy comforted, cheered, and strengthened
me to tread bravely the thorny path of my daily life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110"
id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost before we had time to compose ourselves there would come a
silent sign from the mute matron in the chair&mdash;the thirty minutes
had passed. &#8220;Good-by,&#8221; we say, with a lingering look, and
then turn our backs upon each other, she to go one way, I another; one
leading out into the broad, open day, the other into the stony gloom of
the prison. Do you wonder that when I went back into my lonely cell the
day had become darker? I went forth to meet a crown of joy and love,
only to return with a cross of sorrow; for these visits always created
passionate longings for freedom, with their vivid recollections of past
joys that at times were almost unbearable. No one will ever know what
my mother suffered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Letter from Lord Russell</span></h3>

<p>As the years passed the repression of the prison system
developed a kind of mental numbness which rendered my life,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in a measure, more endurable. It also came as a relief to my own
sufferings to take an interest in those of my fellow prisoners. Then
Lord Russell of Killowen wrote me a letter<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
expressing his continued confidence in me, which greatly renewed my
courage, while the loving messages from my friends in America kept
alive my faith in human nature.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Punished for Another&#8217;s Fault</span></h3>

<p>By the exercise of great self-control and restraint I had maintained
a perfect good-conduct record at Woking for a period of years, when an
act of one of my fellow prisoners got me into grievous trouble.</p>

<p>It is the rule to search daily both the cell and the person of all
prisoners&mdash;those at hard labor three times a day&mdash;to make
sure that they have nothing concealed with which they may do themselves
bodily injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112"
id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>To me it was a bitter indignity. I was never allowed to forget that,
being a prisoner, even my body was not my own. It was horrible to be
touched by unfriendly hands, yet I was compelled to submit&mdash;to
be undressed and be searched. During the term of my imprisonment I
was searched about ten thousand times, and on only one occasion was
anything found contrary to regulations. I had no knowledge of it at
the time, as the article had been placed surreptitiously in my cell by
another prisoner to save herself from punishment.</p>

<p>The facts are as follows: I was working in the kitchen, when a
prisoner upset some boiling water on my foot. I thought it best not to
speak of it, and did not, therefore, mention it to any one. My foot,
however, became inflamed and caused me great pain, and the prisoner in
question, noticing that I limped, inquired what the matter was. I told
her that the coarse wool of my stocking was irritating the blister on
my foot. Thereupon she offered to give me<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> some wool of a finer
quality with which to knit a more comfortable pair. I was not aware at
the time that this was not permitted, nor that the wool was stolen.
When it neared her turn to be searched, having a lot of this worsted
concealed in her bed, she made the excuse of indisposition in order to
return to her cell and get rid of it. While there she transferred it
from her cell to mine, its neighbor, the doors of the cells being open
during working-time.</p>

<div class="figcenter illus">
<a id="plate5"></a>
<img src="images/i127.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="center noindent">BARONESS VON ROQUES,<br />
The mother of Mrs. Maybrick.</p>
</div>

<p>When the time came to search my cell, the wool was, of course,
found, and I was at once reported. The warder took me to the
penal ward, and I was shut in a cell, in which the light came but
dimly through a perforated sheet of iron. This was at eight <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span> At ten o&#8217;clock I was brought before the
governor for examination and judgment. I stated that the wool did not
belong to me and that I was ignorant as to how it got into my cell. The
governor took the officer&#8217;s deposition to the effect that it was
found in my cell, and reasoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> that I must, therefore, have knowledge
of the article. I was taken back to the punishment cell and left there
for eight hours. When the officer opened the door to read to me the
governor&#8217;s judgment, I was found in a dead faint on the floor.
With some difficulty I was restored to consciousness and was then
removed to the hospital. When I had sufficiently recovered from the
shock, I was allowed to return to my own cell in the hall to do my
punishment. I was degraded for a month to a lower stage, with a loss of
twenty-six marks, and had six days added to my original sentence.</p>

<p>Had this offense occurred under the more enlightened system that
obtains at Aylesbury Prison at the present time, I should have
been forgiven, as it was a first offense under this particular
rule. The governor at Woking was a just and humane man, and he
was not a little troubled to reconcile the fact of my being in
possession of this worsted, when I had no means of access to the
tailor shop or of coming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> contact with any of the workers there
who alone had the handling of it. Of course, I could not explain that
the worsted had been passed into the kitchen by one of the tailoresses,
who came every morning to fetch hot water for use in the tailor-room,
and who was a friend of the prisoner who put it in my cell.</p>

<p>I was kept in the hall during the months of my penal
punishment, and also for twelve months thereafter, since at that
time a &#8220;report&#8221; always carried with it a loss of the
privilege of working in the kitchen. When I had an opportunity, in
&#8220;association time,&#8221; of speaking to the prisoner who had
got me into this trouble, and reproached her for the injury she had
done me, she frankly confessed her deed, but excused herself by saying
that she did not expect I would be punished; that she was tempted
to do it because at that time her case was under consideration at
the Home Office, and that she had received the promise of an early
discharge if she did not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> any &#8220;reports.&#8221; She well knew
that if this worsted had been found in her cell this promise would have
been revoked. As she was a &#8220;life woman,&#8221; and had served a
long time, I had not the heart to deprive her of this, perhaps her only
chance of freedom, through a vindication of myself. A week later I had
the satisfaction of knowing that my silence had been the means of her
liberation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Forms of Punishment</span></h3>

<p>The punishment of prisoners at Woking consisted of:</p>

<p>1. Loss of marks, termed in prison parlance, &#8220;remission on her
sentence,&#8221; but without confinement in the penal ward.</p>

<p>2. Solitary confinement for twenty-four hours in the penal ward,
with loss of marks.</p>

<p>3. Solitary confinement, with loss of marks, on bread and water from
one to three days.</p>

<p>4. Solitary confinement, with loss of marks, on bread and
water for three days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117"
id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> either in a strait-jacket or
&#8220;hobbles.&#8221; Hobbling consists in binding the wrists and
ankles of a prisoner, then strapping them together behind her back.
This position causes great suffering, is barbarous, and can be enforced
only by the doctor&#8217;s orders.</p>

<p>5. To the above was sometimes added, in violent cases, shearing
and blistering of the head, or confinement in the dark cell. The dark
cell was underground, and consisted of four walls, a ceiling, and a
floor, with double doors, in which not a ray of light penetrated. No. 5
punishment was abolished at Aylesbury, but in that prison even to give
a piece of bread to a fellow prisoner is still a punishable offense.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The True Aim of Punishment</span></h3>

<p>Punishment should be carried out in a humane, sympathetic spirit,
and not in a dehumanizing or tyrannous manner. It should be remedial
in character, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> degrading and deteriorating. It should
be the aim and object of the prison system to send a prisoner back into
the world capable of rehabilitating himself or herself and becoming
a useful citizen. The punishment in a convict prison, within my
knowledge, is carried out in an oppressive way, the delinquent is left
entirely to herself to work out her own salvation, and in nine cases
out of ten she works out her own destruction instead, and leaves prison
hardened, rancorous, and demoralized.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Evil of Collective Punishment</span></h3>

<p>There are so many prisoners with whom complaint-making is a mania,
who on every possible occasion make trivial, exaggerated, and false
complaints, that it is not altogether strange that officials look
with a certain skepticism on all fault-finding; hence it frequently
happens that those with just grievances are discredited because of the
shortcomings of the habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119"
id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> grumblers. At the same time, one can not
disapprove too strongly of collective punishment which involves the
utter absence of trust in any prisoner, however deserving. A prisoner
slightly abuses a privilege or is guilty of some small infringement of
the rules, when down comes the hammer wielded by the inexorable Penal
Code, and strikes not only the one offending, but, in its expansive
dealing, all the other prisoners, guilty or innocent of the offense.
Many a privilege, trivial in itself and absolutely harmless, has been
condemned because of its abuse by one prisoner.</p>

<p>I cite one instance. Each cell was provided with a nail on which,
during the day, the prisoner could hang a wet towel, and, during the
night, her clothes. Those who worked in the laundry came in with wet
clothing every evening, which, as no change is allowed, must be either
dried at night or put on wet the next morning. One prisoner pulled
her nail out and purposely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> wounded herself. She was weak-minded,
and no doubt thought to excite pity. The matter was referred to the
director, Mr. Pennythorne, who gave the order that all the nails
throughout the building be removed. Hence, because of the shortcomings
of one weak-minded woman, all opportunity for the working women to
dry their clothes was taken from them. Others besides myself appealed
to the director and protested. He replied that we would be obliged
to submit to the edict the same as the rest, and that no distinction
could be made in our favor. Of course we could not argue the matter;
the penalty fell heavier upon the laundry women and the kitchen
workers than upon myself. It is a glaring instance of the great wrong
done by collective punishment. However, the prisoners had their
revenge, for they never referred to him afterward except as &#8220;Mr.
Pennynails.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Evil of Constant Supervision</span></h3>

<p>Individual supervision is compulsory, and in many cases it is
essential, but not in all. Surely there are some prisoners who might,
with good results, be trusted. The supervision is never relaxed; the
prisoner is always in sight or hearing of an officer. During the day
she is never trusted out of sight, and at night the watchful eye of
the night officer can see her by means of a small glass fitted in
the door of each cell. She may grow gray during the length of her
imprisonment, but the rule of supervision is never relaxed. Try and
realize what it means always to feel that you are watched. After all,
these prisoners are women, some may be mothers, and it is surely the
height of wickedness and folly to crush whatever remnant of humanity
and self-respect even a convict woman may still have left her. These
poor creatures who wear the brand of prison shame are guarded and
controlled by women, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"
id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> men make the rules which regulate every
movement of their forlorn lives.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Good Points of Convict Prisons</span></h3>

<p>The rules of prison, rigorous as they are, are not wholly without
some consideration for the hapless beings who are condemned to suffer
punishment for their sins within their gloomy walls. On the men&#8217;s
side the system is harsher, the life harder, and the discipline more
strict and severe; and I can well believe that for a man of refinement
and culture the punishment falls little short of a foretaste of
inferno. But gloomy and tragic as the convict establishment is, it
is a better place than the county prison, and I have heard habitual
criminals avow that a convict prison is the nearest approach to a
comfortable &#8220;home&#8221; in the penal world. I know that a
certain type of degenerate women, after serving their sentences, have
committed grave offenses with the sole object of obtaining a<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
conviction which would send them back to penal servitude. For such the
segregation system would be the most effectual remedy.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Sickness</span></h3>

<p>I had never been a robust woman, and the hardships of prison life
were breaking down my constitution. The cells at Woking were not
heated. In the halls were two fireplaces and a stove, which were alight
day and night; but as the solid doors of the cells were all locked,
the heat could not penetrate them. Thus, while the atmosphere outside
the cell might be warm, the inside was icy cold. During the hard
winter frosts the water frequently froze in my cell over night. The
bed-clothing was insufficient, and I suffered as much from the cold
as the poorest and most miserable creature on earth. Added to this,
I was compelled to go out and exercise in all kinds of weather. On
rainy days I would come in with my shoes and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> stockings wet through,
and as I possessed only one pair of shoes and one pair of stockings,
I had to keep them on, wet as they were. The shoes I had to wear
until worn out; the stockings until changed on the Saturday of each
week, which was the only day a change of any kind of underwear could
be obtained, no matter in what condition it might be. Therefore,
the majority of the inmates in the winter time seldom had dry feet,
if there was much rain or snow, the natural result being catarrh,
influenza, bronchitis, and rheumatism, from all of which I suffered in
turn.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Taken to the Infirmary</span></h3>

<p>As long as the prisoner is not feverish she is treated in her own
cell in the ward, her food remaining the ordinary prison dietary; but
as soon as her temperature rises, as occurred in my case frequently,
she is admitted as a patient to the infirmary, where she is fed
according to medical prescription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The infirmary stands a little detached from the prison grounds. It
has several wards, containing from six to fifteen beds, and several
cells for cases that require isolation. The beds are placed on each
side of the room, and are covered with blue and white counterpanes.
At the head of each is a shelf, on which stand two cups, a plate, and
a diet card. In the middle of each room is a long deal table. On the
walls are a few old Scriptural pictures.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Utter Desolation of a Sick
Prisoner</span></h3>

<p>When a prisoner is admitted she is first weighed and then allotted
a bed. Her food and medicine are given her by an officer, who places
it on a chair at her bedside if she is too ill to sit at the table.
The doctor makes his rounds in the morning and evening, and if the
patient is seriously ill he may make a visit in the night also.
The matron in charge goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126"
id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> through the wards at stated times to
see that all is going well, but there is no nursing. The prisoner must
attend to her own wants, and if too weak to do so, she must depend upon
some other patient less ill than herself to assist her. To be sick in
prison is a terrible experience. I felt acutely the contrast between
former illnesses at home and the desolation and the indifference of the
treatment under conditions afforded by a prison infirmary. To lie all
day and night, perhaps day after day, and week after week, alone and in
silence, without the touch of a friendly hand, the sound of a friendly
voice, or a single expression of sympathy or interest! The misery and
desolation of it all can not be described. It must be experienced. I
arrived at Woking ill, and I left Woking ill.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER SIX<br />

At Aylesbury Prison</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Removal from Woking</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I had</span> been admitted
to the infirmary suffering from a feverish cold. I had been in
bed a fortnight and was feeling very weak, when, on the morning
of November 4, 1896, I awoke to find the matron standing at my
bedside. &#8220;Maybrick,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the governor has
given orders that you are to be removed to-day to Aylesbury Prison.
Get up at once.&#8221; Without a word of explanation she left. I
had become a living rule of obedience, and so with trembling hands
dressed myself. Presently I heard footsteps approaching. A female
warder entered with a long, dark cloak covered with broad arrows,
the insignia of the convict. I was told to put on this garment of
shame. Then, supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> by the warder, I crossed the big yard to
the chief matron&#8217;s office. There other women of the &#8220;Star
Class&#8221; were waiting, handcuffed. A male warder stepped forward
and told me to hold out my hands, whereupon he fastened on a pair of
handcuffs and chained me to the rest of the gang. This was done by
means of a chain which ran through an outer ring attached to each pair
of handcuffs, thus uniting ten women in a literal chain-gang. This
was to me the last straw of degradation&mdash;the parting indignity
of hateful Woking; but, happily, this was a painful prelude to a more
merciful r&eacute;gime at Aylesbury.</p>

<p>Some of the women were weeping, some swearing. When all were ready
the prison-van drove into the yard and we filed out to the clanking of
our chains. Then the door was shut and we were driven off. A special
train was waiting at the station, and escorted between male warders we
got in. It was bitterly cold and raining heavily, but crowds lined the
road and platforms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New Insignia of Shame</span></h3>

<p>We were objects of morbid curiosity to the idle and curious people,
who may or may not have felt sorry for us. But to be stared at was most
distressing to all, to the first offender in particular. If the public
but realized how prisoners suffer when their disgrace is thus brought
to the public notice, they might feel ashamed of their lack of ordinary
human consideration and pass on. But why should it be necessary at all
to subject a prisoner to such humiliation and degradation? Male as well
as female prisoners could be transferred from one prison to another
without attracting any notice in the street or at the station, if they
were provided with garments for traveling upon which the hideous brand
of shame&mdash;the &#8220;broad arrow&#8221;&mdash;is not stamped.
It is this mark of condemnation which attracts the morbid curiosity
of the people. Such exhibitions and the callous disregard of a<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
prisoner&#8217;s feelings can only harden and embitter the heart and
lower his or her self-respect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Arrival at Aylesbury Prison</span></h3>

<p>After a journey of nearly five hours we arrived at Aylesbury
Station. The public were apparently aware that the first batch of
convicts was to be transferred that day, as there were crowds at all
the stations at which we stopped. When we got out at Aylesbury it was
with difficulty that a passage was made for us. The prison-vans were
in readiness, and we were rapidly driven away. I felt weak and faint
and cold. A thick fog enveloped the town, and I could see only the
dim outlines of houses appearing and disappearing as we passed along.
We stopped before what appeared a gigantic structure, and then drove
through two large iron gates into a small courtyard. There we descended
and drew up in line to be counted by the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> officer, while our
numbers and names were given to the governor, who stood waiting to
receive us. The order &#8220;Pass on!&#8221; was called by the matron
in charge, whereupon we entered a long, dark, gloomy passage, at the
end of which was a strong, barred door. This was unlocked, and, when we
had passed in, relocked.</p>

<p>I have already described what a prison is like. Again we stood
in line. Then a male warder came forward. He unlocked my handcuffs
and unclasped the chain which bound me to my fellow convicts. With a
clang that echoed through the empty halls they fell together to the
ground. My wrists were bruised and sore from the long pressure of their
combined weight.</p>

<p>Presently the order &#8220;Pass on!&#8221; was repeated, and, led by
a female warder, we went up two flights of the iron stairway to the top
ward of the hall. Each prisoner was then in turn locked into a cell.
Thus ended my second journey as a prisoner.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> The contrast with former
journeys in my life drew bitter tears from my eyes.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the week daily batches of prisoners
continued to arrive, and on the sixth day all had been duly transferred
from Woking Prison, which was then turned into military barracks.</p>

<p>After this short break in our prison life the same daily routine was
once more taken up. Whether it was due to the change of air or other
physical causes I can not say, but from the time of my arrival I began
to droop. I lost strength and suffered terribly from insomnia.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A New Prison R&eacute;gime</span></h3>

<p>Six months after our arrival, there came a change of
authorities, and with the passing of the years a more enlightened
r&eacute;gime was instituted by the Home Office. If a prisoner has
any complaint to make or wishes to seek advice, she asks to have
her name put down to see the governor.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> She is then termed a
&#8220;wisher,&#8221; and is &#8220;seen&#8221; by him in his office in
the presence of the chief matron. Her request is written down by him in
her penal record, and if he can not settle the matter out of hand it is
referred to a &#8220;visiting director,&#8221; to whom the prisoner is
permitted to make a statement. If this gentleman finds that his powers
are insufficient to deal with the question, he in turn passes it on to
the prison commission, and sometimes it goes even to the Secretary of
State himself.</p>

<p>The same privilege holds good concerning medical matters. If a
prisoner is feeling ill she asks the officer in charge of the ward
where she is located to enter her name on the doctor&#8217;s book. At
ten o&#8217;clock the prisoner is sent for, and sees the doctor in the
presence of an infirmary nurse. He enters her name in a book, also the
prescription, both of which are copied later in the prisoner&#8217;s
medical record. If a prisoner is dissatisfied with the treatment
she is receiving, she can make application<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> to see the
&#8220;medical inspector,&#8221; who comes to the prison every three
months. But if neither the governor, nor the doctor, nor the director,
nor the inspector gives satisfaction, then there is the &#8220;Board of
Visitors&#8221; to inquire into the complaint.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Board of Visitors</span></h3>

<p>The idea of the &#8220;Board of Visitors&#8221; is to act as a
guaranty to the public that everything is honest and above board, and
that there can be no possibility of inhuman treatment. If this is the
sole object in view&mdash;namely, that the prisoners shall be seen by
these &#8220;visitors&#8221;&mdash;then the object is largely attained.
They have done much to ameliorate the prisoners&#8217; condition.
Whereas, at one time the women slept in their clothes, they are now
provided with nightdresses; instead of sitting with their feet always
on the stone floor, they are now allowed a small mat, as well as a
wooden stool; and, as the result of many<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> complaints regarding
the rapid decay of teeth, toothbrushes are allowed, a concession which
I much appreciated. For a short time felt slippers were granted us,
but these have been discontinued on the ground of expense. The same
beneficent influence also secured wide-brimmed hats for the women.
Formerly they had nothing to protect their eyes, and the reflected
glare from the stone walls was the cause of much weakness and
inflammation.</p>

<p>There were several changes in the diet also. Tea was substituted for
cocoa at breakfast and supper, white bread in lieu of wholemeal bread,
and tinned meat replaced the dry bread and cheese previously given on
Sunday.</p>

<p>The time of solitary confinement was reduced from nine months
to four, and immediately on its expiration the probationers can
now work in &#8220;association&#8221; in either the laundry or the
tailor&#8217;s shops where the officers&#8217; uniforms&mdash;of
brown cashmere in summer and navy-blue serge<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> in winter&mdash;are
made, besides all the clothing for the prisoners&#8217; own use; also
in the twine-room, where excellent spinning is done; while the prisoner
with special aptitude may be recommended to the bead-room, which turns
out really artistic work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Regulations Concerning Letters and
Visits</span></h3>

<p>The prisoners were also allowed to receive three photographs of near
relatives and to keep them in their cells. Previously these had to be
returned within twenty-four hours. Best of all, the intervals between
letters and visits were reduced by a month. The number of letters
permitted to be sent by a prisoner varies according to the stage she
is in. In the fourth stage a letter is allowed every two months, and
a &#8220;special letter&#8221; occasionally, if the prisoner&#8217;s
conduct has been satisfactory.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the prison<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> regulations concerning
communications between prisoners and their friends:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The following regulations as to communications, by visit
or letter, between prisoners and their friends, are notified for the
information of their correspondents:</p>

<p>&#8220;The permission to write and receive letters is given to
prisoners for the purpose of enabling them to keep up a connection with
their respectable friends, and not that they may be kept informed of
public events.</p>

<p>&#8220;All letters are read by the prison authorities. They must be
legibly written, and not crossed. Any which are of an objectionable
tendency, either to or from prisoners, or containing slang or improper
expressions, will be suppressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners are permitted to receive and to write a letter
at intervals, which depends on the rules of the stage they attain by
industry and good conduct; but matters of special importance to a
prisoner may be communicated at any time by letter (prepaid) to the
governor, who will inform the prisoner thereof, if expedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;In case of misconduct the privilege of receiving and writing
a letter may be forfeited for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money, books, postage-stamps, food, tobacco, clothes, etc.,
should not be sent to prisoners for their use in prison, as nothing is
allowed to be received at the prison for that purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Persons attempting to clandestinely communicate with, or
to introduce any article to or for prisoners, are liable to fine or
imprisonment, and any prisoner concerned in such practises is liable to
be severely punished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners&#8217; friends are sometimes applied to by
unauthorized persons to send money, etc., to them privately, under
pretense that they can apply it for the benefit of the prisoners, and
under such fraudulent pretense such persons endeavor to obtain money
for themselves. Any letter containing such an application received by
the friends of a prisoner should be at once forwarded by them to the
governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners are allowed to receive visits from their friends,
according to rules, at intervals which depend on their stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;When visits are due to prisoners notification will be sent to
the friends whom they desire to visit them.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>While in Woking Prison, under the privilege of these rules, I wrote
the following letter to the late Miss Mary A. Dodge (&#8220;Gail
Hamilton&#8221;)&mdash;she who was my most eloquent and steadfast
champion in America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">P 29, June 24, 1892.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Dodge</span>:</p>

<p>I feel that I owe you such a debt of gratitude for the truly noble,
beautiful, and womanly manner in which you have used that glorious
gift of God&mdash;your genius&mdash;in the cause of a helpless and
sorely afflicted sister, whose claim to your compassion was but that
of a common humanity and nationality, that I feel I must send you a
few lines, if only to disabuse your mind of any lingering doubts of
my gratitude that my silence may have caused to arise. My dear mother
has, I believe, explained to you the almost insurmountable difficulty I
find in writing to friends abroad, with only<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> one letter every two
months at my disposal, and which I do not feel justified in depriving
her of. I can, therefore, only express through her from time to time my
heartfelt thanks for all that has been and is still being done in my
behalf. I utterly despair, however, of finding words that shall convey
to you even the faintest idea of the fulness of a heart completely
overwhelmed by the sympathy, kindness, and generosity of my friends. My
feelings of love, however, and admiration for you and them is simply
beyond all power of expression.</p>

<p>The world may and does bemoan the gradual extinction in this
generation of those finer and nobler traits of character which
our forefathers so beautifully exemplified; lays at the door of a
higher civilization the terrible increase of selfishness, pride, and
indifference to all the higher duties of Christianity. But, I ask,
where can a grander exception be found to such apparent degeneration
than that displayed by the conduct of those truly noble men and
women, who, without a thought of self or of the trouble involved,
have stood forth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141"
id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> plead the cause of their countrywoman?
Could man do more than he is doing? Could woman do more for her nearest
and dearest than the ladies of America are doing for me? No! a thousand
times, no!</p>

<p>Some day, my health and purse permitting, I shall hope to tell them
face to face, if mere words can tell, how greatly their faithful,
unwearying efforts, their undaunted energy, their sympathy and kindness
and generosity have helped me to rise above the depressing influences
of the injustice I am suffering under, to endure patiently, to bear
bravely the hardships of this life, and to feel through all that the
hope and comfort afforded me by their help is but a beautiful example
of the way in which God answers the prayers of his people.</p>

<p>I would now fain beg of you, dear friend, to express my deepest
and most heartfelt gratitude to President Harrison, Mr. Blaine, and
the other members of the Cabinet. Also to all the distinguished

Oh, how wretchedly I have expressed what I really feel and would like

realize the feelings I find it so hard to express. It would be a still
more hopeless task to try to tell you what I think of you&mdash;noblest

<h3><span class="smcap">A Visit from Lord Russell</span></h3>

<p>I was sitting in my cell one day feeling very weak and ill. I was
recovering from an attack of influenza, and the cold comfort<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> of
my surroundings increased the physical and mental depression which
accompanies this complaint. I wondered vaguely why my life was spared,
why I was permitted to suffer this terrible injustice, when my sad
thoughts were distracted by the sounds of approaching voices. I arose
from my seat&mdash;which is a compulsory attitude of submission when an
authority approaches a prisoner&mdash;and stood waiting for I knew not
what. Presently I heard the tones of a voice which I can never forget
while memory lasts, though that voice is now hushed in death; a voice
which, through the darkest days of my life, ever spoke words of trust,
comfort, and encouragement. Surely I must be dreaming, I thought, or my
mind is growing weak and I am becoming fanciful; for how should this
voice reach me within these prison walls? I looked up, startled, and
once more thought my mind was wandering, for there stood the noblest,
truest friend that woman ever had: the champion of the weak and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the oppressed; the brave upholder of justice and law in the face of
prejudice and public hostility&mdash;Lord Russell of Killowen, Lord
Chief Justice of England. He stepped into my cell with a kindly smile
on his face, and sat down on my stool, while the governor waited
outside. He talked to me for half an hour, and I can never forget the
beauty and grandeur of that presence. As he rose to leave he turned
toward me, and, seeing unshed tears in my eyes, he took my hand in his,
and in his strong, emphatic way said: &#8220;Be brave, be strong; I
believe you to be an innocent woman. I have done and will continue to
do all I can for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been denied in England that Lord Russell took any interest
in me other than he might in any client he was paid to defend; but the
letter which I have already given, written to me at Woking, as well as
various statements made by him, and quoted elsewhere, must set that
aspersion at rest.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER SEVEN<br />

A Petition for Release</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Denied by the Secretary of State</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I had</span> been at Aylesbury about eight months when I petitioned the
Secretary of State for a reconsideration of my case, with a view to
my release. To this I received the usual official reply, &#8220;Not
sufficient grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>A prisoner may petition the Secretary of State every three months.
In my opinion, the privilege of petitioning on a case should be reduced
from four times a year to once a year, with the provision that if
anything of importance to a prisoner transpires within that period it
may be duly submitted to the Secretary of State on recommendation of
the governor or director;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146"
id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> that all complaints regarding food,
treatment, or medical attention should be referred to the visiting
director in the first instance, instead of the Secretary of State,
who under the present system passes it back to the directors for
the necessary investigation. This would do away with the continual
daily distress and irritation and disappointment created in the
prison on receipt of unfavorable replies from the Home Office. A
prisoner petitions. A private inquiry is held, to which the prisoner
is not a party, and of which she has no information, nor does she
receive any during its progress or after its conclusion, save that
the result, which is nearly always negative, is communicated to her.
In this inquiry any one who is opposed to the prisoner may seek
to influence the official mind. I will state a case in point. A
friend asked the Secretary of State for the United States, the Hon.
John Hay, to interest himself in my case. Mr. Hay replied that he
had been informed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147"
id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> Home Office that I had been &#8220;a
disobedient and troublesome prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Report of My Misconduct Refuted</span></h3>

<p>When I was told this at a visit I had my name entered to see the
governor. I insisted that the governor should inform me when, and after
what breach of the rules, such a report had been sent to the Home
Office. After carefully looking through my penal record he could find
no entry to that effect, and concluded by saying that I must have been
misinformed. He said that my conduct was good, and that he had never
made any report to the contrary. Obviously, therefore, this report from
the Home Office to Mr. Hay was due to an adverse influence, of which
I have still no knowledge. Statements are made against a prisoner,
of the nature of which she is entirely ignorant. Being ignorant, she
has no way of refuting them. Worse still, they are retained in the
Home Office to her dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148"
id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> day, and the unfortunate woman knows
nothing of them or their effect. The only thing certain is that she is
further condemned.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Need of a Court of Criminal Appeal</span></h3>

<p>The Home Office, while exercising a private function of
reconsideration grounded on the royal prerogative of mercy,
emphatically disclaims being a court of appeal or a judicial tribunal
in any sense of the word. Yet the consideration of a convict&#8217;s
case rests alone with the Secretary of State. It is a matter of
unwritten law that the Home Secretary shall act individually and solely
upon his own responsibility, and none of his colleagues are to assume
or take part therein.</p>

<p>There are numerous instances where judges, witnesses, and juries
have gone wrong. Indeed, it will be found that even in cases which have
seemed the clearest and least complicated in the trial grievous<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
mistakes have been made. But in England the blame rests on the public
and the bar in that no means are provided to set the wrong right.
What a difference it would have made in my life if I had been granted
a second trial! I could have called other witnesses, submitted
fresh evidence, and refuted false testimony. Is it not the climax
of injustice that men and women, if sued for money, even for a few
shillings, can appeal from court to court&mdash;even to the House of
Lords, the English court of last resort; but when character, all that
life holds dear, and life itself, are in jeopardy, a prisoner&#8217;s
fate may depend upon the incompetent construction of one man, and there
is no appeal?</p>

<p>A hard-worked Secretary of State, whose time, night and day,
is crowded with every kind of duty, correspondence, and labor, in
the House of Commons or in the Home Office, has to consider a vast
number of petitions, complaints, and miscarriages of justice, or too
severe sentences, any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"
id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> of which might require hours and
sometimes days to investigate. He is assisted by several officers, but,
strange to say, it is no part of their qualifications (or that of the
Home Secretary himself), that they should be familiar with the criminal
law or the prosecution or defense of prisoners. These permanent
officials are, besides, occupied with hundreds of other matters which
come before the Home Office, on which they have to guide their chief.
Think of the untold sufferings of individuals and families, the shame
and degradation which they would be spared, if England had a court of
criminal appeal.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Historic Examples of British Injustice</span></h3>

<p>The Home Office detects and corrects a larger number of erroneous
verdicts than the public is aware. This arises from the secret and
partial methods of remedying miscarriages of justice frequently
adopted. The first object is to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> the public belief in
the infallibility of judges and juries. If an innocent person could
slip out quietly, without shaking this belief, he might be permitted
to do so. The Home Secretary is, in fact, a politician, who has little
time to spare for the consideration of criminal cases, and furthermore
must see to it that his conduct does not injure his party. Thus he is
often deterred from interfering with verdicts and sentences by sheer
timidity. When he affirms a sentence he can throw the greater part
of the blame on others if he is afterward proved to be wrong; but
when he reverses either verdict or sentence, he must take the whole
responsibility upon himself. This is, I believe, the true explanation
of the secret and partial reversals which are not unusual at the
Home Office. The Home Secretary, as well as his subordinates, must
frequently let &#8220;dare not wait upon I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>If a crime is committed and no one is brought to justice,
the police are blamed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"
id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> but if a person is convicted the police
are praised, without regard as to whether the right person has been
convicted. Hence there is usually a strong effort to beat up evidence
against the person suspected, as in my case and that of Adolf Beck
(see page 155), and to keep back anything in favor of the prisoner
that comes to the knowledge of the police. When an appeal is made
from the verdict to the Home Secretary, the first step is to consult
the very judge who is responsible, in nine cases out of ten, for the
erroneous verdict. It is easy to see that, where such reference is
made, the judge is liable to be biased in support of his own rulings.
How much more the ends of justice would be furthered by having the case
retried!</p>

<p>God only knows how many men and women have been innocent of the
charges brought against them, and for which they have been unjustly
punished. I will mention a few only of many cases on record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153"
id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>A man, Hebron by name, was convicted at Manchester, of murder. He
was sentenced to death, but fortunately this was commuted to penal
servitude for life. After serving two years the real murderer, a
man named Peace, was discovered, and Hebron was &#8220;graciously
pardoned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another cruel case was that of John Kensall, who was convicted
of murder, but, through action taken by the late Lord Chief Justice
Russell, was shown to be innocent. The Home Office could not at first
&#8220;see its way to interfere,&#8221; and had it not been for Lord
Russell&#8217;s clear head and splendid generalship, by which the
authorities at the Home Office were outwitted, he would not have been
released so soon.</p>

<p>The case of the man Hay, wrongly convicted, was of a serious
nature, showing that he was the victim of a conspiracy; yet had
it not been for Sir William Harcourt&#8217;s instituting an
investigation independent of the Home Office, it is very doubtful
whether Hay would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> able to establish his innocence. But he
did so, and a pardon was granted him.</p>

<p>It looks almost as if justice in England were growing of late
more than ordinarily blind. Thrice, within three years, has the Home
Secretary&#8217;s &#8220;pardon&#8221; been granted to men found to
have been wrongfully convicted.</p>

<p>The average man takes it for granted that these hideous mistakes
must, of necessity, be few and far between; but the criminologist knows
better. He, at all events, is well aware that every year a number
of innocent people are sentenced to suffer either an ignominious
death upon the scaffold, or the long-drawn-out living death of penal
servitude.</p>

<p>Many of these judicial miscarriages never come to light at
all. Others are purposely glossed over by the powers that be. But
occasionally one occurs of so appalling a nature that it rivets the
attention and shocks the conscience of the entire civilized world, as
in the case of Adolf Beck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Case of Adolf Beck</span></h3>

<p>Adolf Beck was twice convicted for crimes committed by a man who
somewhat resembled him. He served his first sentence and had been
convicted for a second crime on &#8220;misrepresented identity&#8221;
when his innocence was providentially established. The case is too
lengthy for detailed account in these pages, and I shall content
myself in giving the summing-up of Mr. George R. Sims in the pamphlet
reprinted from his presentation of the case in the columns of <cite>The
Daily Mail</cite> of London:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have told in plain words the story of a foul wrong done to
an innocent man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved beyond all question that Adolf Beck was in
1896, by the Common Sergeant, Sir Forrest Fulton, at the Old Bailey,
sentenced to seven years&#8217; penal servitude for being an ex-convict
named John Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that he was <em>not</em> found guilty of being John
Smith by the jury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The former conviction for which Mr. Adolf Beck was sentenced
and punished was not only never submitted to the jury, but they were
warned by the judge that they were not to take the issue of Beck being
Smith into consideration in arriving at their verdict. They were to
dismiss it completely from their minds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that if this issue had been left for the
jury to consider they must have acquitted Mr. Beck, who showed by an
indisputable alibi that he could not be Smith, the man convicted in
1877.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that this terrible mockery of justice, the
conviction of an innocent man for a series of crimes that it was quite
impossible he could have committed, was brought about by the action of
the leading counsel for the Treasury, which action was supported by the
Common Sergeant, Sir Forrest Fulton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that the evidence of the policeman, Eliss
Spurrell, which was used at the police-court to assist in getting Beck
committed for trial, was kept out at the Old Bailey, where it would
have insured Beck&#8217;s acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157"
id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that at the police-court in 1896 Mr. Gurrin,
the Treasury expert, reported that all the documents connected with the
1896 frauds were in the handwriting of John Smith of 1877.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that at the 1896 trial at the Old Bailey Mr.
Gurrin swore that, to the best of his belief, all the documents were in
the disguised handwriting of Mr. Beck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that no one in his senses could at the trial
have accepted the theory that Adolf Beck was John Smith after listening
to the evidence of Major Lindholm, Gentleman of the Chamber to the King
of Denmark, Col. Josiah Harris, and the Consul-General for Peru at
Liverpool.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Common Sergeant accepted as true their evidence of a
complete alibi for Mr. Beck, so far as 1877 and the years Smith was in
prison were concerned, or he would, it is to be presumed, have taken
measures to have those gentlemen prosecuted for committing wilful and
corrupt perjury in order to defeat the ends of justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that Beck, after his imprisonment,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
compelled the Home Office authorities to acknowledge that he was
not Smith, and to admit the physical impossibility of his being
Smith&mdash;Smith was a Jew, and he, Beck, was not&mdash;and that
therefore, by the evidence of the Treasury witnesses, he had been
wrongfully committed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that Beck was stripped and officially examined
for body marks before his trial, in order that such marks might be
compared with those on the record in the possession of the authorities
as the body marks of John Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that Adolf Beck had none of the body marks of
John Smith, the man in whose handwriting Mr. Gurrin had declared the
incriminating documents of 1896 to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that all the petitions setting forth these
facts and others, which fully established Beck&#8217;s innocence, met
with no consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that when the frauds of 1877 and 1896 were
repeated in 1904, and the incriminating documents were found to be
in the handwriting of 1877, stroke for<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> stroke, peculiarity for
peculiarity, almost word for word, the fact that the authorities had
admitted that Mr. Beck <em>could not be</em> the author of the 1877 frauds
or the writer of the 1877 documents was utterly ignored, and the
responsible authorities, with every proof of Mr. Beck&#8217;s innocence
in their possession, allowed him to be arrested, charged, tried, and
convicted again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that the identification of Mr. Beck by the
female witnesses as the man who robbed them was a monstrous farce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that, so far from Mr. Beck being the
&#8216;double&#8217; of John Smith, he was utterly unlike him, except
that each had a gray mustache. Beck had neither the noticeable scar
at the point of the jaw nor the noticeable wart over one eye that are
striking marks of identity in John Smith&mdash;marks which would not
escape the most casual observer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that Beck&#8217;s conviction in 1896 was
secured by a device which was utterly unworthy of a British court
of justice&mdash;a device so unfair and unjust that an innocent
and inoffensive foreigner, a Norwegian<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> who had sought the
hospitality of our shores, was by its employment sent into penal
servitude for seven years for the crimes of another man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have proved that Mr. Beck was in 1904 convicted of
repeating letter for letter, word for word, trick for trick, check for
check, false address for false address, false name for false name, the
frauds of 1877 and 1896, of which the authorities had absolute proof
that he was innocent, and of which, though they had never remitted one
day of his sentence, they had <em>admitted</em> that he was innocent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been careful to keep to the main issue, and have
refrained from examining the side issues, some of which reveal most
lamentable features in connection with our criminal procedure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will prove one thing more, and leave the facts I have
established to the judgment of the public.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of the report of the second trial of Adolf Beck,
which took place at the Old Bailey on June 27, 1904 (Sessions Paper
CXL., Part 837), are these words, printed as I give them below:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;GUILTY. <i>He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of
obtaining goods by false pretenses at this Court on February 26, 1896.
Judgment respited.</i>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleaded guilty to a former conviction! Adolf Beck pleaded
guilty to nothing. How could he plead guilty, being an innocent man! He
cried aloud when the charge of the first conviction was read aloud to
him, &#8216;As God is my witness, I was innocent then as I am innocent
now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The epilogue to the tragedy of our English Dreyfus is written
in those damning words in the Sessions Paper, the official minutes of
evidence in Central Criminal Court trials.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beck&#8217;s last hope had perished. Once more a merciless
fate had blinded the eyes and closed the ears of Justice to his
innocence. He was to be immured in a convict cell for ten, perhaps
for fourteen, years; he was to pass the closing years of his life a
branded felon amid all the horrors of a convict prison. In all human
probability he would die without ever seeing the light of freedom
again, for he could not have borne this second torture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162"
id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;His voice, crying aloud for freedom, would be heard no more.
Petitions for a reinvestigation of his case would be hopeless. He had
been robbed of his last earthly chance of proving his innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those words, &#8216;The prisoner pleaded guilty to a former
conviction,&#8217; would have damned him to the last day of his
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;My painful task is ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;A foreigner, a stranger within our gates, a man of kindly
heart and gentle ways, has been foully wronged. There is but one
reparation we can make him. The people of this country owe him a
testimonial of sympathy that shall endure and remain. On the site of
his martyrdom there should rise a national monument. Let that monument
take the form of a Court of Criminal Appeal. That is the one reparation
that the English people can make to Adolf Beck for the foul wrong he
has suffered in their midst.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In a sense the innocent man who is hanged may be regarded as better
off than he who is called upon to endure lifelong imprisonment. There
are plenty of examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> of these judicial murders. Over a
score of undoubted cases occurred in the first two decades of the
last century, and since then there have been twice as many more. A
notorious and awful case was that of Eliza Fenning, who, at eighteen
years of age, was sent to the gallows upon the perjured evidence of an
accomplice of the real murderer. The latter afterward confessed.</p>

<p>Another similar case occurred in 1850, when a man named Ross was
executed for poisoning his young wife by mixing arsenic with her food.
A few years later certain facts came to light, proving conclusively
that the real criminal was a female acquaintance and confidante of the
dead woman.</p>

<p>Thomas Perryman, again, was found guilty in 1879 of the murder
of his aged mother on the very flimsiest of evidence. His sentence
was commuted to penal servitude for life, and in the ordinary
course of events he should now be free. More than 100,000 people
have, at different times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> petitioned for the release of this
convict, and the highest judicial authorities have expressed their
belief in his entire innocence of the crime imputed to him. Yet he has
been compelled to drink his terrible cup to the bitter dregs.</p>

<p>In 1844 a gentleman named Barker was sentenced to penal servitude
for life for a forgery of which he was afterward proved to have been
wholly innocent. He served four years, and was then released and
readmitted to practise as an attorney. In 1859, eleven years after
having been &#8220;pardoned,&#8221; he was, upon the recommendation
of a Select Committee of the House of Commons, voted a sum of
&pound;5,000, &#8220;as a national acknowledgment of the wrong he had
suffered from an erroneous prosecution.&#8221;</p>

<p>The famous Edlingham case will doubtless be fresh in the minds
of most people. In February, 1879, the village vicarage was
entered by burglars, and a determined attempt was made to murder
the aged incumbent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165"
id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> For this outrage two men, Brannagham
and Murphy, were sentenced to lifelong imprisonment. After a lapse of
nine years the crime was confessed to by two well-known criminals named
Richardson and Edgell, the result being that the innocent convicts were
released, with an honorarium of &pound;800 apiece.</p>

<p>The eminent King&#8217;s Counsel, Sir George Lewis, has openly
said that he will not allow himself to speak of the way in which
the &#8220;Edalji&#8221; trial was conducted, and he further adds:
&#8220;I have it on undoubted authority that every &#8216;M.P.&#8217;
connected with the legal profession believes as I do that that man
is innocent. And yet a declaration from such a source is allowed by
the public to pass unnoticed. As I have before stated, &#8216;it is
not the business of the public, nor of individual citizens, to prove
the innocence of any unhappy person whom the process of law selects
for punishment; but it is the business of every citizen to see that
the courts incontestably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166"
id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> prove the guilt of any person accused
of a crime before sentence is passed.&#8217; Neither condition was
fulfilled in the case of the prisoner. I have studied the evidence, and
say, from knowledge gained by fifteen years&#8217; association with
criminals, that this unfortunate young man is <em>innocent</em>.&#8221; Surely
after the disclosures of the Adolf Beck case this one, on the word of
Sir George Lewis, ought to receive unbiased consideration from the Home
Office.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> our arrival at
Aylesbury Prison there was no chapel. Divine service was held in
one of the halls, in which the prisoners assembled each morning for
twenty minutes of service. This arrangement had many disadvantages,
and one of the ladies on the Board of Visitors came nobly to our
relief with an offer to provide the prison with a chapel. The Home
Office &#8220;graciously&#8221; accepted this generous proposition,
and twelve months later it was completed and dedicated by the Lord
Bishop of Reading. (It was burned to the ground since my departure from
Aylesbury.)</p>

<p>On the day preceding the ceremony I<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> was asked to assist in
decorating the chapel with flowers kindly sent by Lady Rothschild. It
was a delicate expression of sympathy for the prisoners, which she
repeated on all high festival days. She was deeply affected when I told
her how profoundly the women appreciated her recognition of a common
humanity.</p>

<p>On the appointed day all work was suspended to enable the prisoners
to be present. In the galleries were seated the families of the
governor, chaplain, and doctor; at the right of the altar the generous
donor of the chapel, Adeline, Duchess of Bedford, was seated with
her friends. The organist played a prelude, and then the bishop,
accompanied by the chaplain and the clergymen of the diocese, entered
the chapel. After a hymn had been sung, a short service followed,
and then the bishop stepped forward and, facing the altar, read the
&#8220;dedication service.&#8221; It was most impressive. Then followed
a prayer and a hymn, and the service was over. The prisoners<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> filed
back to their respective cells and the visitors made the tour of the
prison.</p>

<p>I was a patient in the infirmary at the time, but had received
permission to attend the chapel. Before the Bishop of Reading left the
prison he visited the sick, and as he passed my cell he stopped and
spoke to me words of hope and encouragement, adding his blessing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Influence of Religion upon Prisoners</span></h3>

<p>Another occasion on which the Bishop of Reading visited the prison
was the holding of a confirmation service. Many women of earnest
minds in prison sought in this manner to prove the sincerity of their
repentance and their resolution to live godly lives; and, with one
exception, all those confirmed that day have remained true to their
profession.</p>

<p>Penal servitude is a fiery test of one&#8217;s religious
convictions. One&#8217;s faith is either strengthened and
deepened or else it goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170"
id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> under altogether. I have witnessed many
a sad spiritual shipwreck within those walls.</p>

<p>On a dark, gloomy day in October the rain pattered against the
window of my cell and the wind howled dismally around that huge
&#8220;house of sorrow.&#8221; Now and then the sound of weeping broke
upon the stillness, and I prayed in my heart for the poor souls in
travail whose pains had broken through the enforced rule of silence.
There is no sound in all the world so utterly unnerving as the hopeless
sob of the woman in physical isolation who may not be spiritually
comforted. Separated from loved ones, beyond the reach of tender hands
and voices, she has no one, as in former years, to share her sufferings
or minister to her pain. Alone, one of a mass, with no one to care but
the good God above; for &#8220;to suffer&#8221; thus is the punishment
that man has decreed.</p>

<p>The humanizing influences, in my opinion, can be brought to bear
upon prisoners with beneficial results only when supported<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
by the advantages of religious teachings. During the early part of
my sentence there were Scripture readers, laymen and laywomen, in
all convict prisons, to assist the chaplain in his arduous duties;
but, on the ground of expense, these have been dispensed with, thus
practically removing the only means of administering the moral medicine
which is essential to the cure of the habitual prisoner&#8217;s mental
disease.</p>

<p>A large amount of crime is due to physical and mental degeneration.
Nevertheless, crime is also the result of lovelessness, when it is not
a disease, and the true curative system should give birth to love in
human souls. There is not a man or woman living so low but we can do
something to better him or her, if we give love and sympathy in the
service and have an all-embracing affection for both God and man.</p>

<p>If the future system is to treat the criminal in a curative
or reformative way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172"
id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> rather than by punitive methods, the
means to this end must certainly be increased. Even the worst woman
can be approached through the emotional side of her nature. A kind
word, a sympathetic look, a smile, a little commendation now and then,
given by the officers in charge, would soon gain the respect and
confidence of the prisoner, and thereby render her the more amenable
to rules and regulations. A prisoner with whom I worked, and whose
inner life by near association was revealed to me, had got into a very
morbid, depressed state of mind. She was under close observation by
the doctor&#8217;s orders. Her penal record was not a good one; her
hasty temper was continually getting her into trouble, and when she was
punished she would brood over it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Suicide of a Prisoner</span></h3>

<p>One day she asked for permission to see me; the permission
was refused. She made the request a second time, and, the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> fact
coming to the knowledge of the chaplain, he advised that it be granted,
believing, from his personal knowledge of my influence in the prison,
that it would have a beneficial effect. I was allowed to see her, and
after a few minutes&#8217; conversation she appeared brighter. I told
her that the people of God have a promise of a Comforter from heaven to
come to them and abide with them, even in tribulation and in prison.
She promised me she would try to be more submissive and accept her
punishment in a better spirit. For several days after she seemed to
improve. But one afternoon she once more made the request to be allowed
to see me. As none of the authorities were in the building at the time,
and the chief matron could not take upon herself the responsibility
of granting the request, it was refused. I felt rather anxious about
it, but was helpless. At five o&#8217;clock that evening, just before
supper was served, the woman was found dead in her cell; she had
hanged herself to the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174"
id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> She was only twenty-four years of age,
and was serving a five years&#8217; sentence for shooting her betrayer
under great provocation. The tragedy was naturally kept quiet; none of
the prisoners knew of it until the following morning. How the truth
got abroad I do not know, but when the doors were unlocked after
breakfast, instead of the women passing out of their cells in the usual
orderly way, they rushed out, shouting excitedly at the top of their
voices: &#8220;M&mdash;&mdash; has hanged herself; ... she was driven
to it!&#8221; In vain the officers tried to pacify them or to explain
the true state of things; they would not listen, and continued to
scream: &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to us&mdash;you are paid to say that!
If you did not say that it was all right you would be turned out of the
gates!&#8221; And the uproar increased. As I have already stated, the
&#8220;Star Class&#8221; was sandwiched between two wards of habitual
criminals, and we had the benefit of every disturbance. During the
excitement one of the ringleaders caught<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> sight of me and shouted:
&#8220;Mrs. Maybrick, is it true that M&mdash;&mdash; was driven to
it?&#8221; The tumult was increasing and was growing beyond the control
of the warder, when the chief matron, becoming alarmed, sent up word
that I might explain to the women. Accompanied by an officer, I did
so, and in a few minutes the uproar calmed down and the women returned
quietly to their cells. I have reason to believe that I always had
the full confidence of my fellow prisoners; they were quick to know
and appreciate that I had their welfare at heart, and that I never
countenanced any disobedience or breach of the rules. A first offender,
under sentence for many years, will suffer from the punishment
according as she maintains or damages her self-respect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tragedies in Prison</span></h3>

<p>Above others there are four tragic prison episodes which, once
witnessed, can never be forgotten:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"
id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Breaking bad news to a prisoner&mdash;telling her that a dear one
in the outside world is dying, and that she may not go to him; that
she must wait in terrible suspense until the last message is sent, no
communication in the mean time being permitted.</p>

<p>2. Receiving an intimation of the death of a beloved father, mother,
brother or sister, husband or child, whose visits and letters have been
the sole comfort and support of that prisoner&#8217;s hard lot.</p>

<p>3. The loss of reason by a prisoner who was not strong enough to
endure the punishment decreed by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>4. The suicide, who prefers to trust to the mercy of God rather than
suffer at the hands of man.</p>

<p>Why should a woman be considered less loving, less capable
of suffering, because she is branded with the name of
&#8220;convict?&#8221; She may be informed that her nearest and
dearest are dying, but the rules will permit no departure to relieve
the heart-breaking suspense. In the world at large telegrams<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> may
be sent and daily bulletins received, but not in the convict&#8217;s
world.</p>

<p>Death is a solemn event under any circumstances, and reverence for
the dead is inculcated by our religion, but to die in prison is a thing
that every inmate dreads with inexpressible horror. When a prisoner is
at the point of death, she is put into a cell alone, or into a ward,
if there is one vacant. There she lies alone. The nurse and infirmary
officers come and go; her fellow prisoners gladly minister to her;
the doctor and chaplain are assiduous in their attentions; but she is
nevertheless alone, cut off from her kin, tended by the servants of the
law instead of the servants of love, and it is only at the very last
that her loved ones may come and say their farewell. Oh! the pathos,
the anguish of such partings&mdash;who shall describe them? And when
all is over, and the law has no longer any power over the body it has
tortured, it may be claimed and taken away.</p>

<p>The case of the prisoner who becomes<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> insane is no less
harrowing. She is kept in the infirmary with the other patients for
three months. If she does not recover her reason within that period,
she is certified by three doctors as insane and then removed to the
criminal lunatic asylum. In the mean time the peace and rest of the
other sick persons in the infirmary are disturbed by her ravings, and
their feelings wrought upon by the daily sight of a demented fellow
creature.</p>

<p>And the suicide! To see the ghastly and distorted features of a
fellow prisoner, with whom one has worked and suffered, killed by
her own hands&mdash;such scenes as these haunted me for weeks; and
it needed all my reliance on God to throw off the depression that
inevitably followed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Moral Effect of Harsh Prison Regime</span></h3>

<p>Have you ever tried to realize what kind of life that must
be in which the sight of a child&#8217;s face and the sound of
a child&#8217;s voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179"
id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> are ever absent; in which there are
none of the sweet influences of the home; the daily intercourse with
those we love; the many trifling little happenings, so unimportant in
themselves, but which go so far to make up the sum of human happiness?
It commences with the clangor of bells and the jingling of keys, and
closes with the banging of hundreds of doors, while the after silence
is broken only by shrieks and blasphemies, the trampling of many feet,
and the orders of warders.</p>

<p>In the winter the prisoners get up in the dark, and breakfast in
the dark, to save the expense of gas. The sense of touch becomes
very acute, as so much has to be done without light. Until I had
served three years of my sentence I had not been allowed to see my
own face. Then a looking-glass, three inches long, was placed in my
cell. I have often wondered how this deprivation could be harmonized
with a purpose to enforce tidiness or cleanliness in a prisoner. The
obvious object in depriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180"
id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> prisoners of the only means through
which they can reasonably be expected to conform to the official
standard of facial cleanliness is to eradicate woman&#8217;s assumed
innate sense of vanity; but whether or no it succeeds in this, certain
it is that cleanliness becomes a result of compulsion rather than of
a natural womanly impulse. Also she must maintain the cleanliness of
her prison cell on an ounce of soap per week. After I left Aylesbury
I heard that the steward had received orders from the Home Office to
reduce this enormous quantity. If true it will leave the unfortunate
prisoners with three-quarters of an ounce of soap weekly wherewith
to maintain that cleanliness which is said to be next to godliness.
The prisoners are allowed a hot bath once a week, but in the interval
they may not have a drop of hot water, except by the doctor&#8217;s
orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181"
id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Attacks of Levity</span></h3>

<p>All human instincts can not be crushed, even by an act of
Parliament, and sometimes the prisoners indulge in a flight of levity,
which is, however, promptly stopped by the officer in charge. But
even wilfulness and levity are to some a relief from the perpetual
silence. A young girl, fifteen years of age, came in on a conviction
of penal servitude for life. In a fit of passion she had strangled
a child of which she had charge. In consideration of her youth and
the medical evidence adduced at her trial, sentence of death was
commuted. She was in the &#8220;Star Class,&#8221; and it aroused my
indignation to witness her sufferings. A mature woman may submit to
the inevitable patiently, as an act of faith or as a proof of her
philosophy; but a child of that age has neither faith nor philosophy
sufficient to support her against this repressive system of torture.
At times, however, the girl had attacks of levity which manifested
themselves in most amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> ways. One day she was put out to work
in the officers&#8217; quarters and told to black-lead a grate. With a
serious face she set to work. Presently the officer asked whether she
had finished her task, to which she meekly replied &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
at the same time lifting her face, which, to the utter amazement of the
female warder, had been transformed from a white to a brightly polished
black one.</p>

<p>On another occasion she was told that she would be wanted in the
infirmary. She was suffering great pain at the time, and had begged the
doctor to extract a tooth. When the infirmary nurse unlocked her door
she was found in bed. This is strictly against the rules, unless the
prisoner has special permission from the doctor to lie down during the
day. Of course, the officer ordered her to get up at once, to which
she replied, &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked
the officer. &#8220;Because I can&#8217;t,&#8221; the girl repeated.
Whereupon the officer lifted off the bed covering to see<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> what
was amiss. To her astonishment she saw that the child had got inside
the mattress (which I described in the beginning as a long sack stuffed
with the fiber of the coconut), and had drawn the end of it on a string
around her neck, so that nothing but her head was visible.</p>

<p>It has been said that no apples are so sweet as those that are
stolen, and the great pleasure the women in prison derive from their
surreptitious levity is because it can so rarely be indulged in, and
the opportunities for its expression must always be stolen.</p>

<p>There is an axiom in prison, &#8220;The worse the woman, the better
the prisoner.&#8221; As one goes about the prison, and observes those
women who are permitted little privileged tasks, such as tidying the
garden, cleaning the chapel, or any of the light and semi-responsible
tasks which convicts like, one will notice the privileged are
not, as a rule, the young or respectably brought up, but old,
professional criminals. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> know the rules of the prison, they spend
the greater part of their lives there, and they know exactly how to
behave so as to earn the maximum of marks; their object is to get out
in the shortest possible time, and to have as light work as possible
while they are in. The officers like them because they know their work
without having to be taught. &#8220;There is no servant like an old
thief,&#8221; I have heard it said. &#8220;They do good work.&#8221;
This is quite typical of a certain kind of prisoner who is the mainstay
of the prisons.</p>

<p>The conviction of young girls to penal servitude is shocking, for
it destroys the chief power of prevention that prisons are supposed to
possess, and accustoms the young criminal to a reality which has far
less terror for her than the idea of it had. Prison life is entirely
demoralizing to any girl under twenty years of age, and it is to
prevent such demoralizing influence upon young girls that some more
humane system of punishment should be enacted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185"
id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Self-Discipline</span></h3>

<p>In saying a word on what is, perhaps, best described as
&#8220;prison self-discipline,&#8221; I trust the reader will acquit
me of any motive other than a desire that it may result in some
sister in misfortune deriving benefit from a similar course. That the
state of mind in which one enters upon the life of a convict has some
influence on conduct&mdash;whether she does so with a consciousness
of innocence or otherwise&mdash;should, perhaps, go without saying.
Nevertheless, innocent or guilty, a proper self-respect can not fail
to be helpful, be the circumstances what they may; and from the moment
I crossed Woking&#8217;s grim threshold until the last day when I
passed from the shadow and the gloom of Aylesbury into God&#8217;s
free sunlight, I adhered strictly to a determination that I would
come out of the ordeal&mdash;if ever&mdash;precisely as I had entered
upon it; that no loving eyes of mother or friends should detect in
my habits, manners, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186"
id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> modes of thought or expression the
slightest deterioration.</p>

<p>Accordingly I set about from the very start to busy myself&mdash;and
this was no small helpfulness in filling the dreary hours of the
seemingly endless days of solitary confinement&mdash;keeping my cell
in order and ever making the most of such scant material for adornment
as the rules permitted. Little enough in this way, it may be imagined,
falls to a convict&#8217;s lot. Indeed, the sad admission is forced
that nearly every semblance of refinement is maintained at one&#8217;s
peril, for &#8220;motives&#8221; receive small consideration in the
interpretation of prison rules, however portentously they may have
loomed in the process that placed an innocent woman under the shadow
of the scaffold, and only by grace of a commutation turned her into a
&#8220;life&#8221; convict.</p>

<p>Come what would, I was determined not to lose my hold on the
amenities of my former social position, and, though I had only a wooden
stool and table, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187"
id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> always spotless, my floor was ever
brightly polished, while my tin pannikins went far to foster the
delusion that I was in possession of a service of silver.</p>

<p>Confinement in a cell is naturally productive of slothful habits
and indifference to personal appearance. I felt it would be a
humiliation to have it assumed that I could or would deteriorate
because of my environment. I therefore made it a point never to
yield to that feeling of indifference which is the almost universal
outcome of prison life. I soon found that this self-imposed regimen
acted as a wholesome moral tonic, and so, instead of falling under
the naturally baneful influences of my surroundings, I strove, with
ever-renewed spiritual strength, to rise above them. At first the
difference that marked me from so many of my fellow prisoners aroused
in them something like a feeling of resentment; but when they came
to know me this soon wore off, and I have reason to believe that my
example of unvarying neatness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"
id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> and civility did not fail in influencing
others to look a bit more after their personal appearance and to
modify their speech. At any rate, it had this effect: Aylesbury Prison
is the training-school for female warders for all county prisons.
Having served a month&#8217;s probation here, they are recommended,
if efficient in enforcing the prison &#8220;discipline,&#8221; for
transference to analogous establishments in the counties. It happened
not infrequently, therefore, that new-comers were taken to my cell as
the model on which all others should be patterned.</p>

<p>I partook of my meals, coarse and unappetizing as the food might be,
after the manner I had been wont in the dining-room of my own home;
and, though unseen, I never permitted myself to use my fingers (as
most prisoners invariably did) where a knife, fork, or spoon would be
demanded by good manners. Neither did I permit myself, either at table
(though alone) or elsewhere, to fall into slouchy attitudes,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> even
when, because of sickness, it was nearly impossible for me to hold up
my head.</p>

<p>I speak of this because of the almost universal tendency among
prisoners to mere animality. &#8220;What matters it?&#8221; is the
general retort. Accordingly, the average convict keeps herself no
cleaner than the discipline strenuously exacts, while all their
attitudes express hopeless indifference, callous carelessness, to a
degree that often lowers them to the behavior of the brutes of the
field. The repressive system can neither reform nor raise the nature or
habits of prisoners.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Need of Women Doctors and Inspectors</span></h3>

<p>Women doctors and inspectors should be appointed in all female
prisons. Otherwise what can be expected of a woman of small mental
resources, shut in on herself, often unable to read or write with any
readiness; of bad habits; with a craving for<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> low excitement; whose
chief pleasure has been in the grosser kind of animal delight? The mind
turns morbidly inward; the nerves are shattered. Although the dark
cell is no longer used, mental light is still excluded. Recidivation
is more frequent with women than with men. The jail taint seems to
sink deeper into woman&#8217;s nature, and at Aylesbury numbers of the
more abandoned ones are seldom for long out of the male warders&#8217;
hands.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chastening Effect of Imprisonment on the
Spirit</span></h3>

<p>For a considerable period I was given work in the officers&#8217;
mess. Their quarters are in a detached building within the prison
precincts, and are reached by crossing a small grass-plot which
separates it from the prison. Each officer has a small bedroom,
in which she sleeps and passes her time when off duty. All meals
are served in the mess-room, and consist of breakfast at<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
seven o&#8217;clock, lunch on turn between nine and eleven, dinner at
twelve-thirty, tea at five, and supper whenever they are off duty.
The cooking is excellent and varied. A matron is in charge of the
commissariat department, and has four prisoners of the &#8220;Star
Class&#8221; working under her. I did scullery work, which consisted
of washing up all the crockery, glass, knives, forks, and spoons used
at these five meals, besides all the pots and pans required in their
preparation. As a staff of twenty-five sat down to these frequent
meals daily, the work was very hard and quite beyond my strength. The
&#8220;Star Class&#8221; of workers should not be kept at it more than
six months at a time. Some of the life women have been in the kitchen
and mess-room as long as three and four years, and, as neither the
culinary arrangements nor the ventilation are modern, the consequent
physical and mental depression arising from these defects, and the
monotony of the work, is only too apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>I was not feeling well at the time, and soon after I had a long
illness&mdash;a nervous breakdown, due partly to insomnia and partly to
the unrelieved strain and stress of years of hard labor. My recovery
was very slow. I was in the infirmary about eighteen months, and was
glad when finally discharged, as the intervals between my letters
and visits were shorter when I was in discipline quarters and could
earn more marks. During the long years of my imprisonment I learned
many lessons I needed, perhaps, to have learned during my earlier
life; but, thank God, I was no criminal! I was being punished for
that of which I was innocent. I believe it is God&#8217;s task to
judge and ours to endure, but I could not understand what his plans
and his purposes were. I believed they were good, although I could
not see how eternity itself could make up for my sufferings. Perhaps
they were intended to work out some good to others, by ways I should
never know, until I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193"
id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> with the clear eyes of another world.
Still, the external conditions of life acted on my body and mind, and
I scarcely knew at times how to bear them. I could not have endured
them without God&#8217;s sustaining grace. I used often to repeat these
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;With patience, then, the course of duty run;</p>
<p class="i1">God never does nor suffers to be done</p>
<p class="i1">But that which you would do if you could see</p>
<p class="i1">The end of all events as well as he.&#8221;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Death-bed Incident</span></h3>

<p>A woman lay dying in a near-by cell. Of the sixty years of her
life she had spent forty within prison walls. What that life had been
I will not say, but when she was in the agony of death she called to
me: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about your God, but if he has
made you tender and loving to a bad lot like me, I know he will not be
hard on a poor soul who never had a chance. Give me a kiss, dear lass,
before I go. No one has kissed me since my mother died.&#8221;</p>

My Last Years in Prison</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">I am Set to Work in the Library</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> I recovered from my
nervous breakdown, by medical order I was given lighter employment, and
went into the library. I was now the only prisoner in the building who
had suffered under the hardships of the old system at Woking Prison,
all the rest of those who came with me having in the interim returned
to the world. In fact, I was the only one who had served over ten
years.</p>

<p>My task in the library was to assist the schoolmistress and to
change the library books twice a week. They were carried from cell
to cell, and this represented the handling of over two hundred and
fifty books. In addition to this, I had to be<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> &#8220;literary
nurse,&#8221; whose duties were to attend to worn-out books, binding up
their wounds and prolonging their days of usefulness; doing cataloguing
and entry work; to print the name of each prisoner on a card placed
over her cell door; to copy hymns, and to make scrap-books for the
illiterate prisoners, besides other miscellaneous duties.</p>

<p>The library was a very good one and contained not only the latest
novels, but philosophical works and books for study; also a limited
number in French and German. To these were added religious works,
especially poetry, and sermons for Sunday reading. I found a choice
collection to help me support the Sabbath day, for the suspended
animation makes a day of misery of the &#8220;day of rest.&#8221; One
could not read all day without tiring, and the absence of week-day
work usually made it a day of heavy, creeping depression. There
are two periods of exercise, and chapel morning and afternoon. The
remainder of the time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196"
id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> prisoners are locked in their cells.
Reading was my only solace; from first to last I read every moment that
I could call my own. The best index of the quality of the books was
that every volume was read or examined by the chaplain and his staff
before it was admitted to the library. If it contained any articles
on prison life or matters relating to prisoners, these were always
carefully cut out.</p>

<p>From my observations I consider that prison schoolmasters and
schoolmistresses are overburdened with miscellaneous and incompatible
duties. No one needs to be told that the average prisoner is a slow
learner, and that even a dull boy or girl is a better pupil than a
grown man or woman plodding along in the first steps of knowledge, and
who is taught, not in a class, but in a cell. Yet the schoolmaster
or schoolmistress has to devote hours daily to teaching, to help in
letter-writing, in the office work, in the distribution of library
books, in the library work; and now that their<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> number is likewise
reduced on the ground of expense, the pressure of their work is out
of all proportion to the hours within which it can be reasonably
performed.</p>

<p>I have always been fond of reading, and during my leisure hours
I got through a large number of books. This was between noon and
half-past one, and seven and eight in the evening, when my light had to
be put out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Newspapers Forbidden</span></h3>

<p>The rules forbid that any public news be conveyed to the prisoners,
either at visits or by letters. This seems to be a very short-sighted
view to take of the matter. To allow newspapers in the prison might,
of course, lead to cipher communications to prisoners from their
friends; but no harm can possibly come of allowing information
regarding public affairs of national interest to be conveyed through
the legitimate channels of letters and visits. It would give the
prisoners fresh food for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> thought, and tend greatly to relieve
that vacuity of mind which is the outcome of lack of knowledge of
external things, and of the monotony of their lives; it would also make
a pause in their broodings over their cases, which is the sole subject
of their thoughts and conversations when permitted to converse at
all.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How Prisoners Learn of Great Events</span></h3>

<p>The lowering of the prison flag told us of the death of Queen
Victoria, although we had heard several days before that she was
sinking. When King Edward was dangerously ill it was talked of among
the officers, and the prisoners, through me, asked that special prayers
might be said in the chapel.</p>

<p>When Mafeking was relieved and when peace with the Boers was
declared, flags were hoisted. Jubilee and Coronation days were the
only occasions I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199"
id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> when we had any relaxation of prison
rules, and then there was much disappointment, since in lieu of a
mitigation of our sentences, as was the case in India, they gave us
extra meat and plum pudding.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Strict Discipline of Prison Officers</span></h3>

<p>I have served under three governors, each of whom was an intelligent
and conspicuously humane man. They knew their prisoners and tried to
understand them, but there is not much a governor can do for them of
his own initiative. I consider that he who holds this responsible
position should have more of a free hand, and be allowed to use his
discretion in all ordinary matters pertaining to the prison discipline
and welfare of the prisoners.</p>

<p>They were all advanced disciplinarians. The routine reeled
itself off with mechanical precision. The rules were enforced
and carried out to the letter. The deadly monotony never varied;
all days are alike;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200"
id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> weeks, months, years slowly accumulate,
and, in the mean time, the mental rust is eating into the weary brain,
and the outspoken cry rises up daily&mdash;&#8220;How long, O Lord! how
long?&#8221;</p>

<p>The officers are almost as keen as the governor in their efforts to
keep things up to the mark. It is seldom they allow prisoners under
their observation or supervision any slight relaxation which nature may
demand, but the rules forbid. They dislike to punish a woman, and in
their hearts make many excuses for the black sheep.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Their High Character</span></h3>

<p>As a class, with few exceptions, the prison staff is worthy of
respect and confidence, and might be trusted with any task. The
patience, civility, and self-control which the officers exhibit under
the most trying circumstances, as a rule, mark them as men and women
possessing a high sense of duty, not only as civil servants, but as
Christians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Nervous Strain of Their Duties</span></h3>

<p>The hours of work are long, the nervous strain is incessant. I
could wish that those in high places showed a little more appreciation
of what these faithful servants do, and were not so sparing of their
praise and commendation. The small remuneration they receive can not
make up for the deprivation of the amenities of life which the prison
service entails. Two writers on prison life have expressed themselves
in widely different ways regarding the warders and officers. One writer
compares them to slave-and cattle-drivers; another expresses surprise
that they are as good as they are. As, I trust, an impartial observer,
I agree with the latter opinion. Experience has taught me that, in
most cases, if the prisoner is amiable and willing, the officer on
her part is ready to meet the prisoner fully half way&mdash;at all
events, as far as circumstances and duty will permit, for the continual
daily changes of duty, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202"
id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> ward to ward and hall to hall, make it
nearly impossible for any officer to acquire a true knowledge of the
character of those under her charge.</p>

<p>It would be interesting if a trained psychologist could watch
and report upon the insidious effect of the repressive rules and
regulations of a prison on the more impressionable officers and
prisoners. When such officers first enter this service they are natural
women with a natural demeanor and expression of countenance. After a
time, however, the molding effects of &#8220;standing orders&#8221;
become apparent in the sternness of their expression, the harsh tones
of their voices, and the abruptness of their manner.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Standing Orders for Warders</span></h3>

<p>These &#8220;standing orders&#8221; may be paraphrased as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not do this or say that, or look sympathetic
or friendly, or converse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> with prisoners in any way. You must
always suspect them of wishing to do something underhand, sly, and
contrary to orders. You must never let them for a moment out of
your sight, or permit them to suppose that you have either trust or
confidence in them. It is your duty to see that the means of punishment
devised by the Penal Code are faithfully carried out. You are not to
trouble yourself about the result upon the prisoner&mdash;that is the
affair of the Government.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any familiarity on the part of an officer with a prisoner is
strictly forbidden by the rules of prison service, and the slightest
manifestation of the sort would entail serious punishment on the
officer. Surely this is not as it should be; on the contrary, greater
discretionary power should be permitted to officers in their relations
with prisoners, for the influence for good which a kind, well-disposed
officer could exert upon a prisoner is incalculable. But all this
possible influence for good is denied<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> expression by the
spirit of mistrust and suspicion which pervades the entire prison
administration. This is one of the most regrettable features of the
system. No officer is trusted by her superior, and no prisoner, however
exemplary her conduct, may be trusted by any one officially connected
with the institution.</p>

<p>An officer who commits a breach of any rule laid down for her may be
fined a sum varying from one to ten shillings, and if the offense is a
grave one she may be discharged.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crime a Mental Disease</span></h3>

<p>When will those connected with prisons awake to the fact that the
criminal is mentally diseased? Ninety-nine out of a hundred criminals,
when not such by accident, through poverty, or environment, come to
their lot through inherited, malformed brains. It ought to be the
sacred duty of earnest men to deal kindly, intelligently, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>and
patiently with them. The prison, which is now a dreadful place of
punishment and humiliation, ought to be made a home of regeneration and
reformation, in which intelligent effort is made to raise the prisoner
to a higher level; and this surely is not done by withdrawing all the
refining influences.</p>

<p>I hope the time is not far off when men and women will take more
of a heart interest in prisoners, and when, no matter how low they
may have sunk, an opportunity to live honestly will be given them on
their release; when the society against which they have sinned will
treat them so kindly that for very shame they will seek to do better,
and repentance shall enter into the most darkened soul. The &#8220;eye
for an eye and tooth for a tooth&#8221; doctrine is not a part of the
Christian dispensation. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave his last supreme
lesson, as he turned toward the thief at his side on the cross, and
there put an end to that old law forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Something Good in the Worst Criminal</span></h3>

<p>There is some good to be found in the worst criminal, which, if
nourished by patience and sympathy, will grow into more good. I speak
from a large, intimate personal experience, for during my imprisonment
it was my happy fortune to evoke kindly reciprocations from some of the
worst and most degraded characters. I will cite an instance.</p>

<p>One day I was crossing the hall when a fight occurred. I can not
describe it&mdash;it was too horrible. The crowd surged toward me, and
I was being drawn in among the combatants, when one of them, catching
sight of me, stepped out with a face streaming with blood, and pushed
me into an open cell, closing the door after me. When I thanked her the
next day she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless your heart, Mrs. Maybrick, did you think I would
let them hurt a hair of your head?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207"
id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe I had the sympathy and respect of all my fellow prisoners,
and when I left Aylesbury, my feelings were those of mingled relief
and regret. I could not but feel attached to those with whom I had
lived and suffered and worked for so many weary years. I knew, perhaps,
more of the life history of these poor women, their inner thoughts and
feelings, than any one else in the prison. In suffering, in sympathy,
in pity, we were all akin. In the association hour they would bring me
their letters from home to read, and show me the photographs of their
children or other dear ones, while tears would course down their cheeks
at the memory of happier days.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Need of Further Prison Reform</span></h3>

<p>Many opinions have been written regarding prisons, but with few
exceptions they are the observations of outsiders, which means, they
must of necessity be to a certain extent superficial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208"
id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>I have touched only a few spots of the great diseased system of
prison management, but what public opinion did to ameliorate past
abuses, public opinion can still do to improve the treatment of
to-day&#8217;s criminal. A little over a hundred years ago there were
thirty-four offenses in England punishable by capital punishment.
To-day there is only one. Charles Dickens did more than any agency
toward doing away with imprisonment for debt, yet last year there were
no less than eleven thousand prisoners in confinement for debt in
English prisons. How many of these have since joined the ranks of the
criminals through loss of self-respect? What has been the effect upon
their wives and families? Why is a man imprisoned for debt? Certainly
not to enable him to pay it. He can earn nothing while in prison, where
he is supported at the expense of the state; and if he has a wife or
family, they either become dependent on the rates, or incur debts
which he will have to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"
id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> on his release. Again, he may not
improbably lose his employment, and have to look out for another when
liberated, and his imprisonment does not make it more easy, either to
procure work or to perform it efficiently. The ground of imprisonment
is dishonesty. But is not actual dishonesty sufficiently met by the
criminal law? In what sense is the debtor dishonest? Is it meant that
he has money in his pocket and refuses to pay his debts? Is it not
rather that he ought to have had money? It is proved perhaps that
he is earning so much per week, possibly, but how long had he been
earning and how long was he out of employment before that? Has he
had sickness? There have been many instances where a man was in the
hospital when the committal order was made, and was seized and carried
off to prison immediately on discharge. If non-payment of a debt is
not a crime, why is he in prison for it? If it is a crime, why has he
not the benefit of a trial by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210"
id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> jury on the ability or inability of
paying his debts? And why should not the Home Office or other appellate
tribunal have the power of revising his sentence? If the debtor has
goods that can be seized, let them be seized; if there is money coming
to him, let the creditor attach it; if it comes within the scope of
the bankruptcy law, let him be adjudicated and examined on oath to
every shilling that he has received or spent. But why, in the name of
justice and humanity, treat him as a criminal, prevent him from earning
his bread, and make him an incumbrance on the State, exposing his
wife and daughter to ruin, degrading him, lowering his self-respect,
and subjecting him to the taint of the prison atmosphere, without
satisfactory evidence of his ability to pay at the time of committal?
Several prisoners that I came in contact with were made criminals
because their husbands had left their families destitute because
imprisoned for debt.</p>

<h2 class="sub">CHAPTER TEN<br />

My Release</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">I Learn the Time When My Sentence Will
Terminate</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">After</span> I had been
incarcerated for a few years I found out that it was usual in the
case of a life convict who has earned good marks to have her sentence
brought up for consideration after she has served fifteen years. A life
sentence usually means twenty years, and three months is taken off each
year as a reward for good conduct. In February, 1903, I was definitely
informed that my case would follow the ordinary course. I have been
accused of obtaining my release by &#8220;trickery,&#8221; but these
facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The impression has also been given by the press that great
leniency was shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> my case, and that through the
intervention of friends the Home Office released me before the
expiration of my sentence. No exceptional leniency whatever was shown
in my case. It depends upon the prisoner herself whether she is
released at an earlier period or serves the full term of her sentence.
By an unbroken record of good conduct I reduced my life sentence, which
is twenty years, to fifteen years; this expired on the 25th of July,
1904.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dawn of Liberty</span></h3>

<p>As a giant refreshed by sleep, the prison awakens to life,
and the voices of officers, the clang of doors, the ringing of
bells echo throughout the halls. What does it portend? Is it the
arrival of some distinguished visitor from the Home Office? Then I
hear the sound of approaching footsteps, as they come nearer and
nearer and then stop at my cell door. The governor ushers in three
gentlemen&mdash;one tall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213"
id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> dark and handsome, but with a stern
face; another short, with a white beard and blue eyes which looked
at me somewhat coldly; of the third I have no distinct recollection.
The tall gentleman conversed pleasantly for several minutes about my
work and myself, then passed out on his tour of inspection. I did not
know at the time who these visitors were, but learned later that the
gentleman who spoke to me was the Secretary of State, Sir Matthew
White-Ridley; one of his companions was Sir Kenelm Digby, and the other
Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, the chairman of the Prison Committee, who
takes a really humane interest in the welfare of the convicts.</p>

<p>One morning, a week later, I was summoned to appear before the
governor. It is an ordeal to be dreaded by any one who has broken
the rules, but I knew I had not, and therefore concluded that I was
wanted in connection with my work. When I entered the office he looked
up with a kindly smile, which was also reflected in the face<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> of
the chief matron. My attention was arrested. I stood silently waiting
for him to speak. After searching among some papers on the table, he
picked up one and read something to the following effect: &#8220;The
prisoner, P 29, Florence E. Maybrick, is to be informed that the
Secretary of State has decided to grant her discharge from prison when
she has completed fifteen years of her sentence, conditional upon her
conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment I failed to grasp the full meaning of these words,
but when I did&mdash;how shall I describe the mingled feelings of joy
and thankfulness, of relief and hope, with which I was overwhelmed! I
returned to my cell dazed by the unexpected message for which for so
many long, weary years I had hoped and prayed.</p>

<p>How anxiously I waited for those last few months to pass!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Release</span></h3>

<p>It was Christmas Eve of 1903. I had helped to decorate the chapel
with evergreens, which is the only way in which the greatest festival
of the church&#8217;s year is kept in prison. There is no rejoicing
allowed prisoners; no festival meal of roast beef and plum pudding,
only the usual prison diet; and the sad memories of happier days
are emphasized by our bare cells with their maximum of cleanliness
and minimum of comfort. But to me it was the last Christmas in that
&#8220;house of sorrow,&#8221; and my heart felt the dawning of a
brighter day. Only four weeks more and I would have passed out of its
grim gates forever! How I counted those days, and yet how I shrank from
going once more into the world that had been so cruel, so hostile,
so unmerciful, in spite of the fact that there was no proof that I
was the guilty woman they assumed me to be! But kind friends<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and loving hearts were waiting to greet me, to give me refuge and
comfort.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 23d of January, my mother visited me at Aylesbury
Prison for the last time. How many weary and sad hours we had passed in
that visiting-room! Our hearts were too full for much conversation, and
it was with broken voices that we discussed the arrangements made for
my departure on the following Monday.</p>

<p>The last Sunday I spent in prison I felt like one in a dream. I
could not realize that to-morrow, the glad to-morrow, would bring
with it freedom and life. In the evening I was sent for to say
&#8220;Good-by&#8221; to the governor. Besides the chief matron and the
one who was to be my escort to Truro, no one was aware of the day or
hour of my departure from Aylesbury. Not a word had been said to the
other prisoners. I should like to have said farewell to them, also to
the officers whom I had known for fourteen years (for several had come
with us from Woking Prison);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"
id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> but I thought it best to pass into my
new life as quietly as possible. At my earnest request the Home Office
consented to allow my place of destination to be kept a secret. I felt
that I should derive more benefit from the change of my new environment
and association with others, if my identity and place of retreat were
not known to the public.</p>

</div>

<p>On Monday, the 25th of January, I was awakened early, and after
laying aside, for the last time, the garments of shame and disgrace,
I was clothed once more in those that represent civilization and
respectability. I descended to the court below, and, accompanied by the
chief matron and my escort, passed silently through the great gates and
out of the prison. At half-past six a cab drove quietly up, and the
matron and I silently stepped in and were driven away to the Aylesbury
Station. On our arrival in London we proceeded at once to Paddington
Station. The noise and the crowds of people everywhere bewildered
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218"
id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">In Retreat at Truro</span></h3>

<p>After an uneventful journey we arrived at Truro at six <span
class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and drove at once to the Home of the
Community of the Epiphany, where I stayed during the remainder of
my term of six months. I am told that some comment has been made on
the fact that the Home was a religious retreat, and that I ought to
have been sent to a secular one instead. I went there entirely of my
own desire. On our arrival there I bade a last farewell to my kind
companion&mdash;one of the sweetest women it has been my privilege to
meet. The Mother Superior, who had visited me three months previously
at Aylesbury Prison, received me tenderly, and at once conducted me
to my room. How pure and chaste everything looked after the cold,
bare walls of my prison cell! How the restful quiet soothed my
jarred and weakened nerves, and, above all, what comforting balm
the dear Mother Superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219"
id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> and the sweet sisters poured into the
wounds of my riven soul!</p>

<p>I look back upon the six months spent within those sacred walls as
the most peaceful and the happiest&mdash;in the true sense&mdash;of my
life. The life there is so calm, so holy, and yet so cheerful, that
one becomes infected, so that the sad thoughts flee away, the drooping
hands are once more uplifted, and the heart strengthened to perform the
work that a loving God may have ordained.</p>

<p>I passed several hours of each day working in the sewing-room with
the sisters. During my leisure time I read much, and when the weather
was fine delighted in taking long walks within the lovely grounds that
surround the Home. I did not go out in the country, nor attend the
services on Sunday at the Cathedral.</p>

<p>I left Truro on the 20th of July a free woman&mdash;with
a ticket-of-leave, it is true, but as I am exempt from
police supervision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220"
id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> even in England, I have no need to
consider it in America or elsewhere.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of the American Ambassador, the Hon. Joseph H.
Choate, I was provided with an escort to accompany me and my companion
on our journey from Truro to Rouen, France.</p>

<p>The Hon. John Hay, Secretary of State, Washington; the Hon. Joseph
H. Choate, Mr. Henry White, Charg&eacute; d&#8217;Affaires, and
Mr. Carter, Secretary of Embassy, at London, have always been most
earnest in my cause. I deeply appreciate their untiring efforts in my
behalf.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">I Come to America</span></h3>

<p>After staying with my mother for three weeks, on the advice of my
counselors, Messrs. Hayden &amp; Yarrell, of Washington, District
of Columbia, I decided to return to America with Mr. Samuel V.
Hayden and his charming wife. I longed to be once more with my
own people, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221"
id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> only physical weakness and nervous
prostration that prevented me from doing so immediately upon my
release. I met these good friends at Antwerp, Belgium, and sailed from
there on the Red Star Line steamship <cite>Vaderland</cite> for New York. My
name was entered on the passenger list as Rose Ingraham, that I might
secure more quiet and privacy; but when we were a few days out the
fact of my identity became known, and with few exceptions the greatest
courtesy, consideration, and delicacy were shown in the demeanor of the
passengers toward me. If any of these should read these lines I would
herewith express to them my grateful thanks and appreciation; while
toward the captain and officers of the <cite>Vaderland</cite> I feel especially
indebted for their unwearied courtesy and consideration.</p>

<p>When I first caught sight of the Statue of Liberty, I, perhaps more
than any one on board, realized the full meaning of what it typifies,
and I felt my heart stirred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"
id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> its depths at the memory of what all my
countrymen and countrywomen had done for me during the dark days of my
past, to prove that they still carried me in their hearts, though the
great ocean rolled between, and that I had not been robbed of the high
privilege of being an American citizen.</p>

<p>We arrived at New York on the 23d of August. It was a
&#8220;red-letter&#8221; day. Once more, after many years of suffering
and when I had long despaired of ever seeing the beloved faces of my
friends again, my feet once again pressed the sacred soil of my native
land.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Lost Years</span></h3>

<p>A time will come when the world will acknowledge that the verdict
which was passed upon me is absolutely untenable. But what then? Who
shall give back the years I have spent within prison walls; the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
friends by whom I am forgotten; the children to whom I
am dead;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the sunshine; the
winds of heaven; my woman&#8217;s life, and all I have lost by
this terrible injustice?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224"
id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> Time may heal the deepest wounds when
the balm of love and sympathy is poured into them. It is well; for
if mental wounds proved as fatal as those of the body, the prison
death-roll would indeed be a long one.</p>

<h2 class="sub">PART TWO<br />

<span class="ph3">ANALYSIS OF THE MAYBRICK CASE</span></h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Petitions for a Reprieve</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> jury&#8217;s verdict
of guilty was rendered on August 7, 1889. The evidence at the trial,
as well as the learned judge&#8217;s &#8220;summing up,&#8221; was
reported almost verbatim in the English press. The result was that,
not only in Liverpool, but in almost every city, town, and village of
the United Kingdom, men and women of every class and grade of society
arrived at the conclusion that the verdict was erroneous&mdash;as not
founded upon evidence, but upon the biased and misleading summing
up of the case by the mentally incompetent<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> judge. Within a few days
my lawyers, the Messrs. Cleaver, of Liverpool, who had notified the
press that they would supply forms of petition, were inundated with
applications. For the first two days they issued one thousand a day,
and I have been informed that no less than five thousand petitions for
a reprieve, representing nearly half a million signatures, were sent to
the Home Secretary within the following ten days. In response to these,
the Home Office issued to the press the following decision:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;After the fullest consideration, and after taking the best
medical and legal advice that could be obtained, the Home Secretary
advised Her Majesty to respite the capital punishment of Florence
Elizabeth Maybrick and to commute the punishment to penal servitude for
life; inasmuch as, although the evidence leads to the conclusion that
the prisoner administered and attempted to administer arsenic to her
husband with intent to murder him, yet it does<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> not wholly exclude
a reasonable doubt <em>whether his death was in fact caused by the
administration of arsenic</em>.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Illogical Position of Home Secretary</span></h3>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the Home Secretary, Mr. Matthews,
ignored the important statement of the judge at the trial, when, in
giving emphasis to his remarks, he told the jury that: &#8220;It
is <em>essential</em> to this charge <em>that the man died of arsenic</em>. This
question must be the foundation of a judgment unfavorable to the
prisoner, that he died of arsenic.&#8221; Then Mr. Matthews, on
reviewing the evidence given at the trial, finding it impossible to
justify the verdict, because the evidence &#8220;does not wholly
exclude a reasonable doubt whether his [James Maybrick&#8217;s] death
was in fact caused by the administration of arsenic,&#8221; which
question was to be the foundation of a judgment unfavorable to me,
instead of giving his prisoner the benefit of the reasonable<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
doubt, took it upon himself to apply the spirit of the law and of the
constitution, by making use of a wrongful conviction for one offense
charged in order to punish me for a different offense for which I
had never been tried, but with which he, without any public trial,
charged me, viz., &#8220;administering and attempting to administer
arsenic&#8221; to my husband.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New Evidence of Innocence Ignored</span></h3>

<p>These charges, made by Mr. Matthews in 1889, have never been
defined; nor has any statement been submitted to me or my legal
advisers of the evidence relied on to prove them; nor have I been
afforded an opportunity of being heard by counsel in answer to
them, nor of pleading anything in reply to them. Had a second trial
been granted me, I should have seen the evidence upon which the
new charges were made against me, and in open court I could <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>have
confronted the witnesses. But Mr. Matthews sentenced me to penal
servitude for life (without giving me a chance to defend myself against
the charges) which involved nine months&#8217; solitary confinement in
my case&mdash;in itself a most excessive punishment for the untried
and, consequently, unproven charges. He sent me to suffer fourteen and
one-half years on suspicion&mdash;a suspicion not warranted by any
evidence given at the trial. The new evidence, which has been obtained
since my conviction, is admitted by all fair-minded persons to be of
such a nature that it would satisfy any intelligent jury that I was
not only wrongfully found guilty of murder, but was most wrongfully
treated by Mr. Matthews. It completely exonerates me from the charge
of murder as well as &#8220;administering and attempting to administer
arsenic.&#8221; Since this evidence was published, no one has attempted
to justify the conviction or the sentence passed upon me.</p>

<p>Had the jury, instead of finding a verdict of &#8220;guilty&#8221;
of murder, returned a verdict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230"
id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> in the same terms as the finding of Mr.
Matthews, the judge must have entered it as &#8220;not guilty&#8221;
and discharged me.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lord Russell&#8217;s Letter</span></h3>

<p>Well might the Lord Chief Justice Russell of Killowen write me, as
he did on the 27th of June, 1895, telling me that he had never relaxed
his efforts to urge my release, and saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Royal Court</span>, 27th June, 1895.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maybrick</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: I have been absent on
circuit; hence my delay in answering your letter.</p>

<p>I beg to assure you that I have never relaxed my efforts where
any suitable opportunity offered to urge that your release ought to
be granted. I feel as strongly as I have felt from the first that
you ought never to have been convicted, and this opinion I have very
clearly expressed to Mr. Asquith, but I am sorry to say hitherto
without effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231"
id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Rest assured that I shall renew my representations to the incoming
Home Secretary, whoever he may be, as soon as the Government is formed
and the Home Secretary is in a position to deal with such matters.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="mr11">I am,</span><br />
<span class="mr8">Faithfully,</span><br />
<span class="smcap mr1">Russell of Killowen</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>This also seems to be the opinion of the leading counsel for the
prosecution, Mr. Addison, Q.C., M.P. (now Judge Addison, of the
Southwark County Courts), who is reported to have said, after the
summing up, that &#8220;the jury could not, especially in view of the
medical evidence, find a verdict of guilty.&#8221; This statement will
be found in Sir Charles Russell&#8217;s protest to Mr. Matthews.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Efforts for Release</span></h3>

<p>The public are not probably fully aware how much intensity of
feeling and earnest work has been expended on my case during<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> the
fourteen and one-half years of my imprisonment. The Home Office knows.
Men in high positions in both political parties in England have often
united in demanding a new trial. The almost invariable reply has been
that the best means to effect my release was to obtain new facts or
evidence, and submit these to the Home Secretary for his consideration.
Those well-meaning advisers seemed to forget that the half million
of petitioners for my reprieve or free pardon in England&mdash;not
to count those in America&mdash;were not moved thereto by new facts
or evidence, but by the absence of facts or evidence sufficient to
prove that the alleged crime had been committed by any one, or that
either guilt or complicity in that crime, if crime it were, attached
to me. Surely it is not the business of the public nor of individual
citizens to prove the innocence of any unhappy person whom process
of law selects for punishment, while it <em>is</em> the business of every
citizen to see that the courts incontestably<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> prove the guilt of any
person accused of a crime before sentence is passed, in the following
manner:</p>

<p>1. It must be proved that a crime has been committed.</p>

<p>2. It must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
person is the one who committed it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Even New Evidence Superfluous</span></h3>

<p>Neither condition has yet been fulfilled in my case. The evidence on
which a half million petitioners said and say I was unjustly condemned
is sufficient in itself. While it is true if a new trial had been
granted me I could have produced new evidence that overwhelmingly
demonstrated my innocence, it is also true that more facts or new
evidence were not requisite to enable justice to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Doctors&#8217; Doubt</span></h3>

<p>The doctors who gave evidence in favor of death by arsenical
poisoning all stated that they would not have felt certain on the
subject if the one-tenth of a grain of arsenic had not been found
in the body. Therefore, since the presence of that arsenic could
be otherwise accounted for, I was entitled to an acquittal even
on the evidence of the Crown medical witnesses. Moreover, the
symptom on which two or three doctors for the prosecution laid most
stress&mdash;continuous vomiting&mdash;was referred by the third to
morphia administered by himself. All three were examined before any
evidence of Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s habit of arsenic taking was given.
Had they believed him to be an arsenic eater, they might have arrived
at a different conclusion. The doctors for the defense, who declared
that Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s symptoms were not those of arsenical
poisoning, were men of far more experience as regards poisons<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> than
the Crown medical witnesses. The quantity of arsenic found in the
body was, in their opinion, quite consistent with administration in
medicinal doses, and might have been introduced a considerable time
before.</p>

<p>The proved administration of poison with intent to kill
is punishable by penal servitude, but not necessarily for
life&mdash;sometimes for only three years; but the charge must be
proved in open court to be a felonious attempt by some means actually
used to effectuate the intent, and it remains with the prosecution to
produce the necessary evidence that the means used were sufficient for
the accomplishment of the effect.</p>

<p>The medical evidence proved that the quantity of
arsenic&mdash;one-tenth of a grain&mdash;found in Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s
body was not sufficient to have produced death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236"
id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Public Surprise at Verdict</span></h3>

<p><cite>The Times</cite> of August 8, 1889, declared that, of the hundreds of
thousands of persons who followed the case with eager interest and
attention, not one in three was prepared for the verdict. The large
majority had believed that, in the presence of such contradictory
evidence, the jury would give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt and
bring in a verdict as much like the Scotch &#8220;not proven&#8221; as
is permitted by English law.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Character of Jury</span></h3>

<p>There was strong prejudice against me, due to the numerous false and
sensational reports circulated by the press during the interval between
the arrest and the trial. The jury belonged to a class of men who
were not competent to weigh technical evidence,<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and no doubt attached great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> weight to the opinions of the local
physicians, one of whom was somewhat of a celebrity. But the main
element in the conviction was Justice Stephen, whose mind, undoubtedly
owing to incipient insanity (he died insane a year later), was
incapable of dealing with so intricate a case.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &#8220;Mad Judge&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>The Liverpool <cite>Daily Post</cite>, as I am told, had been hostile rather
than favorable toward me, but, on the death of Lord Chief Justice
Russell, that journal, in articles of August 13 and 14, 1900, showed
that it fully appreciated the unfairness of my trial, for it stated
that no human being ought to be handed over to be tried by a &#8220;mad
judge.&#8221; The following is taken from <cite>The Post</cite> of August 13,
1900:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The death of the Lord Chief Justice may have recalled to
the minds of some Liverpool folk a sad and sordid tragedy<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
enacted among them eleven years ago, in which he was a principal
performer. To those who were there, a vivid recollection still
persists of that bright July morning when a thronged court, hushed in
expectancy, awaited the beginning of the Maybrick trial. In fancy one
still hears the distant fanfare of the trumpets as the judges with
quaint pageantry passed down the hall, and still with the mind&#8217;s
eye sees the stately crimson-clad figure of the great mad judge as he
sat down to try his last case. A tragedy, indeed, was played upon the
bench no less than in the dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Few who looked upon the strong, square head can have
suspected that the light of reason was burning very low within; yet
as the days of the trial dragged by&mdash;days that must have been
as terrible to the judge as to the prisoner&mdash;men began to nod
at him, to wonder, and to whisper. Nothing more painful was ever
seen in court than the proud old man&#8217;s desperate struggle to
control his failing faculties. But the struggle was unavailing.
It was clear that the growing volume of facts was unassorted,
undigested in his mind; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> his judgment swayed backward and forward
in the conflict of testimony; that his memory failed to grip the most
salient features of the case for many minutes together. It was shocking
to think that a human life depended upon the direction of this wreck of
what was once a great judge.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Justice Stephen&#8217;s Biased Charge</span></h3>

<p>The charge of Mr. Justice Stephen to the jury positively teemed with
misstatements as to the evidence given during the trial. I quote a
statement from the same journal in its issue of August 17, 1900:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I should be very sorry to think that the same number of
errors as to the matters of fact given in the evidence had ever
been made in any judge&#8217;s charge. It simply swarms with them,
and as the jury at the end of a long trial is likely to prefer the
judge&#8217;s r&eacute;sum&eacute; to their own recollection, I doubt
if the verdict in the Maybrick case was founded on the evidence at
all. And if I am right in thinking that the jurors founded their
verdict on the judge&#8217;s recapitulation<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> of the evidence rather
than on the evidence itself, I do not see how any counsel could have
saved the prisoner.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>That the jury &#8220;did not hear the whole of the evidence very
distinctly&#8221; is admitted by one of them in the Liverpool <cite>Daily
Post</cite> of August 10, 1889. Consequently they were likely to be unduly
influenced by the judge&#8217;s charge. There is no evidence that the
jury detected the judge&#8217;s misstatements, as a more intelligent
jury certainly would have done. Their minds were &#8220;taken
captive&#8221; by the charge of Justice Stephen, and they were as
&#8220;clay in the hands of the potter.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lord Russell&#8217;s Memorandum
Quashed</span></h3>

<p>The Lord Chief Justice sent the Home Secretary a memorandum
consisting of twenty folios, in which he stated the strong opinion
that &#8220;Mrs. Maybrick ought to be released at once.&#8221; The
Lord Chief Justice also requested that the contents of his<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
memorandum be made public. Yet when asked in the House of Commons to
lay the document on the table of the House in order that it might be
accessible to the members, the Home Secretary emphatically declined.
The London <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, in a leader on this incident, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The only conceivable reasons for declining to give publicity
to the letter, which was actually intended for publication, are
apparently official red tape and the fear of giving new life to the
agitation in favor of Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s release. This result will
be almost as effectually achieved by surrounding the case with further
mystery and leaving upon the public mind the grave suspicion that
justice may not have been done.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Repeated Protests of Lord Russell</span></h3>

<p>The following extracts are taken from the &#8220;Life of Lord
Russell of Killowen&#8221; by R. Barry O&#8217;Brien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;In November, 1895, he [Lord Russell] wrote to Sir Matthew
White-Ridley (page 260), conveying his strong and emphatic opinion
that Florence Maybrick ought never to have been convicted; that her
continued imprisonment is an injustice which ought promptly to be
ended, and added: &#8216;I have never wavered in this opinion. After
her conviction I wrote and had printed a memorandum, which I presume
is preserved at the Home Office. Lest it should not be, I herewith
transmit a copy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;As is known, what happened was that Mr. Matthews, after
consultation with the present Lord Chancellor, Lord Salisbury, and Mr.
Justice Stephen, and after seeing Dr. Stephenson, the principal Crown
witness, and also the late Dr. Tidy, respited the capital sentence on
the expressed ground that there was sufficient doubt whether death had
been caused by arsenical poisoning to justify the respite.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be seen (1) that such a doubt existed as to the
commission of the offense for which Florence Maybrick was tried as
rendered it improper, in the opinion of the Home Secretary and his
advisers, that the capital sentence should be carried out; and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> (2)
that for more than six years Florence Maybrick has been suffering
imprisonment on the assumption of Mr. Matthews that she committed an
offense for which she was never tried by the constitutional authority
and of which she has never been adjudged guilty.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>From page 261: &#8220;This is in itself a most serious state of
things. It is manifestly unjust that Florence Maybrick should suffer
for a crime in regard to which she has never been called upon to answer
before any lawful tribunal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not obvious that if the attempt to murder had been
the offense for which she was arraigned, the course of the defense
would have been different? I speak as her counsel of what I know. Read
the report of the defense, and you will see that I devoted my whole
strength to and massed the evidence upon the point that the prosecution
had misconceived the facts, that the foundation on which the whole case
rested was rotten, for that, in fact, there was no murder; that, on the
contrary, the deceased had died from natural causes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true that incidental reference was<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> made
to certain alleged acts of Florence Maybrick, but the references were
incidental only; the stress of my argument being, in fact, that <em>no
murder had been committed, because the evidence did not warrant the
conclusion that the deceased had died from arsenical poisoning</em>. On
the other hand, had the Crown counsel suggested the case of attempt to
murder by poison, it would have been the duty of counsel to address
himself directly and mainly to the alleged circumstances which, it was
argued, pointed to guilty intent. That these alleged circumstances were
capable in part of being explained, in part of being minimized, and
in part of being attacked as unreliably vouched, can not, I think, be
doubted by any one who has with a critical eye scanned the evidence. I
do not deny that my feelings are engaged in this case. It is impossible
that they should not be, but I have honestly tried to judge the case,
and I now say that <em>if I was called upon to advise in my character of
head of the Criminal Judicature of this country, I should advise you
that Florence Maybrick ought to be allowed to go free</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245"
id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>From page 262: &#8220;I think it my duty to renew my protest against
the continued imprisonment of Florence Maybrick. I consider the history
of the case reflects discredit on the administration of the criminal
law. I think my protest ought to be attended to at last. The prisoner
has already undergone punishment for a period four times as long, or
more, as the minimum punishment fixed by law for the commission of
the crime, of which she has never been convicted or for which she has
never been tried, but for which she has been adjudged guilty by your
predecessor in the office of Home Secretary.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The American Official Petition</span></h3>

<p>The following is quoted from the American Official Petition sent to
the Rt. Hon. Henry Matthews, Q.C., M.P., Her Majesty&#8217;s principal
secretary for the Home Department:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;As Florence Elizabeth Maybrick is an American woman,
without father, brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246"
id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> husband, or kin in England, except two
infant children, enduring penal servitude for life in Woking Prison;</p>

<p>&#8220;As the conduct of her trial resulted in a profound impression
of a miscarriage of justice, in an earnest protest against the verdict,
and the execution of the sentence of death, and its commutation to
penal servitude for life on the ground of reasonable doubt whether a
murder had been committed;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a careful legal scrutiny of the evidence given at the
trial by eminent solicitors, barristers, queen&#8217;s counsel, and
members of Parliament, and the production of facts not in evidence at
the trial have resulted in a final decision of counsel that the case
is one proper for the grave consideration of a criminal appellate
tribunal&mdash;if such a tribunal existed;</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore, we earnestly ask that the Rt. Hon. Henry Matthews,
Q.C., M.P., Her Majesty&#8217;s principal secretary of state for the
Home Department, will advise Her Majesty to order the pardon and
release of the prisoner, who has now suffered an imprisonment of three
years.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Secretary Blaine&#8217;s Letter to Minister
Lincoln</span></h3>

<p>I will conclude by quoting the letter of Secretary Blaine to Mr.
Robert Lincoln, then Minister to the Court of St. James. It will be
seen that Mr. Blaine was of opinion that I had lost my citizenship.
Since this letter was written it has been decided by the Supreme Court
of the United States that a woman married to a foreigner, on the death
of her husband can, on application, be reinstated to citizenship.</p>

<p class="center noindent">HON. JAMES G. BLAINE,<br />
American Secretary of State, 1889-1892.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Department of State,
Washington</span>,<br />

<span class="mr2">&#8220;March 7, 1892.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Lincoln</span>: As Mrs.
Maybrick lost her American citizenship by her English marriage, and as
I fear she does not resume it by her widowhood, I can not instruct you
officially as to the course you should pursue toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But her American and Southern birth, her connection with many
families of the highest respectability and even of prominence in the
country&#8217;s service, have attracted much attention to her fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no other interest in her than an interest which you
and I share in common with all our countrymen&mdash;the desire to help
an American woman in distress. That she may have been influenced by the
foolish ambition of too many American girls for a foreign marriage,
and have descended from her own rank to that of her husband&#8217;s
family, which seems to have been somewhat vulgar, must be forgiven to
her youth, since she was only eighteen at the time of her marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a wide and widening belief in this country that
she is legally innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> and illegally imprisoned. The official
charge of the judge that murder must be proved and the official
announcement of the Home Secretary that the evidence leaves a
&#8216;reasonable doubt&#8217; of murder are the premises of but one
conclusion&mdash;the discharge of the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that she was never indicted or tried by a jury
of her peers on a specific count of felonious attempt to administer
arsenic, yet is condemned to penal servitude for life on the Home
Secretary&#8217;s statement that she evidently made such an attempt,
can never be reconciled to the English principle that an accused person
shall be tried by a jury of his peers. Lawyers here are among the
strongest believers in the illegality of her imprisonment. Indeed, the
sense of injustice is developing and deepening into horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Officially I could only instruct you on behalf of a multitude
of American citizens to investigate her case. Personally I beg to
express to you my deep interest in it, and pray you, if possible, to
communicate with Messrs. Lumley and Sir Charles Russell as to any
method of American cooperation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251"
id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> which may seem to them desirable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Messrs. Lumley have made a very able brief, which I am sure
would interest you, and which seems to me unanswerable. Sir Charles
Russell, whose reputation you know, is her counsel. Consult with them
what best can be done, from an American point of view, to secure Mrs.
Maybrick&#8217;s release. And if you shall have read Lumley&#8217;s
brief, I am sure that conviction will lead you to personal activity in
her behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can communicate with me in strict confidence, as from
one American citizen to another, for the relief of an American woman
helplessly enduring a great wrong.</p>

<p>And yet it required the time from March 7, 1892, until July 20,
1904, to attain my liberation; and then it was accomplished by time
limit and by no act of grace or concession on the part of the English
Government.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Henry W. Lucy on Lord Russell</span></h3>

<p><cite>The Strand Magazine</cite>, London, in its November number, 1900,
published an article by Henry W. Lucy, Esq., who, speaking of the late
Lord Chief Justice Russell, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The most remarkable episode in Charles Russell&#8217;s career
at the bar undoubtedly was his defense of Mrs. Maybrick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I happened to find myself in the same hotel with him at
Liverpool on the morning of the day set down for the opening of the
trial. At breakfast he spoke in confident terms of his client&#8217;s
innocence and of the surety of her acquittal. He did not take into
account the passing mood of the judge who tried the case, and so found
himself out of his reckoning; but the verdict of the jury, still less
the summing-up of Fitz-James Stephen, did not shake his conviction.
Sir Charles Russell was of all men least likely to be misled by
appearances or deliberate deception; having<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> probed the case to the
bottom, having turned his piercing eyes on the woman in the dock,
having talked to her in private and studied her in public, he was
convinced of her innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Landoff was a lawyer of high position at the English bar
when, as Mr. Henry Matthews, he came into the Home Office.</p>

<p>&#8220;The verdict of the jury was &#8216;guilty,&#8217; and her
sentence was death, which was a real surprise, as was afterward
learned, even to the judge, Sir Fitz-James Stephen. If Mr. Matthews
believed her guilty, he should not have commuted her sentence upon the
ground that he assigned. If she was guilty she well deserved death on
the scaffold. The evidence, however, satisfied Mr. Matthews that there
was reasonable doubt that the death of Mr. Maybrick was due to arsenic.
In this view, as is well known, he was sustained by Justice Stephen. If
such a doubt really came into Mr. Matthews&#8217;s mind, as was made
the ground of the commutation of the sentence, <em>under English law that
doubt entitled the accused to acquittal</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why he lacked the courage of his convictions can only be
surmised. At all events he did not dare to take the responsibility of
allowing her to be executed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The intercession of the American Government through Mr.
Blaine, Secretary of State, was urgent, strong, and most intense. It is
incredible that Mr. Matthews desired any loophole to release her. The
case was full of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Matthew White-Ridley was not a lawyer, and there is no
probability that he ever read the evidence in the case, which was
voluminous. He could not have read the papers in three days if he had
attempted it. He simply followed his predecessor&#8217;s line and was
not able to take up the case on its merits.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lord Russell&#8217;s Conviction of Mrs.
Maybrick&#8217;s Innocence</span></h3>

<p>This statement of Mr. Lucy is of great value as an answer to the
assault made on Lord Russell&#8217;s memory after his death, on his
firm belief in my innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255"
id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Hugh Cecil wrote to a constituent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I believe I am right in stating that he (Lord Russell) never
said that he believed Mrs. Maybrick to be innocent.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>When this was shown Lord Russell by Mr. A. W. McDougall, Esq., the
Chief Justice exclaimed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Does Lord Hugh Cecil suppose that I would abandon all the
traditions of the Bar and put forward publicly as an argument in such
a case my personal belief in this, that, or the other thing? Does he
suppose that I would have made all the efforts I have been making to
obtain her freedom if I believed her to be guilty?&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Explanation of Attitude of Home
Secretaries</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;Personal Rights,&#8221; of November 15, in commenting on the
statement of Mr. Lucy in <cite>The Strand Magazine</cite>, says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;We do not share the belief that Sir Fitz-James Stephen was
insane in any plenary sense at the time of the trial; but we are
convinced that he was not fully sane. His charge to the jury, the
report of which is reproduced in full in Mr. Levy&#8217;s book, is
grotesquely inaccurate; and if the jury took it to be a compendium
of the evidence&mdash;as they probably did&mdash;the result of their
deliberation is fully accounted for. Indeed, if the facts were such as
the judge stated, the verdict could hardly be impugned. How different
they were may be seen by any one who compares the evidence with the
judge&#8217;s charge, in the book already referred to. To take a single
instance: the judge stated that, according to the evidence of Alice
Yapp, at the commencement of Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s illness, he was very
sick and in great pain immediately after some medicine was given to
him by his wife. Alice Yapp swore nothing of the kind. She saw neither
any administration of medicine nor any sickness. We could give other
instances of gross inaccuracy, generally leading to the conclusion of
the prisoner&#8217;s guilt; but, for our<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> present purpose, the
above incident will suffice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this was the character of the judge&#8217;s charge to the
jury, what confidence can be placed in his notes? Still upon those
notes was probably based the conclusions of successive Home Secretaries
or of the officials employed by them. When Mr. Lucy holds up his hands
in astonishment at the marvelous consensus of opinion of various Home
Secretaries, he seems to us to manifest remarkable blindness&mdash;for
one so long behind the Speaker&#8217;s chair&mdash;as to the vicarious
nature of that opinion. It is more than possible that the conclusions
of Mr. Matthews, Mr. Asquith, and Sir Matthew White-Ridley were all
drawn for them by the same gentleman, or, at least, that the same
gentleman helped these various Home Secretaries to come to the same
conclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hope that Mr. Ritchie, the new Home Secretary, will
judge this matter for himself. Let him read the salient portions, at
least, of Mr. Levy&#8217;s book, and, per contra, the article of X.
Y. Z. in <cite>The Contemporary Review</cite> of September last. If he<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> likes
to make the inquiry, he will find that X. Y. Z. is one of his new
permanent staff, and that the doctrines put forward in the article are
the embodiment of Home Office practise. This is a matter which does
not concern the Maybrick case alone. Scarcely a month passes without
some new manifestation of injustice brought about by adherence to the
traditions of the department over which Mr. Ritchie now presides. If
he will seek out this hydra and slay it, he will leave for himself
an immortal name among Secretaries of State, and&mdash;what he will
hold of more importance&mdash;he will cut off a permanent source of
injustice, give releasement and joy to the innocent pining in prison,
and breathe a new life into a department which is sadly in need of a
renovating spirit.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Upholding the Justiciary</span></h3>

<p>In the same number of this journal is an article from
&#8220;Lex,&#8221; a well-known writer in English journals, which we
reproduce:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259"
id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: May I call attention to the
two articles in the Liverpool <cite>Post</cite> of August 13 and 14, in which
the utter incompetence of the judge at the Maybrick trial is strongly
asserted? The writer is distinctly hostile to the prisoner, and writes
without any intention of raising the question whether the trial was not
null and void; but as the English system consists of trial by judge and
jury, the total incompetence of either element should clearly vitiate
it. Moreover, Mr. Ruggles-Brise, on the occasion of a visit to America
in 1897, stated that the reason of the steadfast refusal of <em>the
Home Secretary to release the prisoner was his desire to uphold the
wholesome authority of the English justiciary</em>. That authority can not
be regarded as wholesome if the judge was insane. Lord Russell, who was
present throughout the trial, was of different opinion from that of the
judge. He was undoubtedly sane. If Sir J. F. Stephen was insane, the
public will, I think, be of opinion that the sane judge should have had
the most influence with the executive.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Need of Court of Criminal Appeal</span></h3>

<p>Lord Esher, in <cite>The Times</cite> of August 17, 1889, strongly advocated
a court of criminal appeal, and <cite>The Times</cite>, in an article of the
same date, supported the views expressed by Lord Esher and by Lord
Fitzgerald, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A court of appeal, as Lord Esher sketches it, would not
be open to the objections which can be fairly urged against our
present informal method of procedure. The Home Secretary, as a
quasi court of appeal, is, as Lord Fitzgerald remarks, not a judge
and has not the power of a judge.... The judgment pronounced by a
strong court of criminal appeal, such as Lord Esher&#8217;s letter
suggests, would do more to satisfy the public mind than the best
efforts of the Home Secretary could possibly do. The reform which
Lord Esher advocates has been long called for, and Lord Fitzgerald
did well to press it on the Government.... What the public feel is
that they would rather have the fallibility<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> of trained judges than
the fallibility of an individual sitting without any of the apparatus
with which a court of law is enabled to detect truth from falsehood,
and perhaps unconsciously confusing the prerogative of mercy with
justice.&#8221;</p></div>

<h2>THE BRIEF OF MESSRS. LUMLEY &amp; LUMLEY</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> brief of Messrs.
Lumley &amp; Lumley, characterized in the preceding letter of Secretary
Blaine as &#8220;very able&#8221; and &#8220;unanswerable,&#8221; is
too long for reproduction in these pages in its entirety, and hence
only the main points are given. The document was prepared at the
instance of Lord Russell of Killowen for submission to himself and
three other Queen&#8217;s Counsel, with a view of obtaining a new
trial. It may interest the reader to know that the money required to
make this searching analysis by Messrs. Lumley &amp; Lumley was raised
by a popular subscription in America, through the good offices of the
New York <cite>World</cite>. The eminent Queen&#8217;s counsel, after a full
consideration of the analysis of the case, submitted the following
opinion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263"
id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Opinion&mdash;Re F. E. Maybrick</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;Having carefully considered the facts stated in the elaborate
case submitted to us by Messrs. Lumley &amp; Lumley, and the law
applicable to the matter, we are clearly of opinion that there is
no mode by which in this case a new trial or a &#8216;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venire de
novo</i>&#8217; can be obtained, nor can the prisoner be brought up on a
&#8216;habeas corpus,&#8217; with the view to retrying the issue of her
innocence or guilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We say this notwithstanding the case of Regina <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vs.</i> Scarfe
(17 Q. B., 238, 5; Cox, C. C., 243; 2 Den., C. C., 281).</p>

<p>&#8220;We are of opinion that in English criminal procedure there
is no possibility of procuring a rehearing in the case of felony
where a verdict has been found by a properly constituted jury upon an
indictment which is correct in form. This rule is, in our opinion,
absolute, unless circumstances have transpired, and have been entered
upon the record, which, when there appearing, would invalidate
the tribunal and reduce the trial to a nullity by reason<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> of
its not having been before a properly constituted tribunal. None of the
matters proposed to be proved go to this length.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think it right to add that there are many matters stated
in the case, not merely with reference to the evidence at and the
incidents of the trial, but suggesting new facts, which would be
<em>matters proper for the grave consideration of a Court of Criminal
Appeal</em>, if such a tribunal existed in this country.</p>

<p>This opinion was based upon the following points, presented by
Messrs. Lumley &amp; Lumley:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Justice Stephen&#8217;s Misdirections</span></h3>

<p>The <em>misdirections</em> which are selected for consideration may be
conveniently classed, among others, under these headings:</p>

<p>1. As to the facts disclosed in the evidence<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> of
the procuring and possession of arsenic by Mrs. Maybrick and of her
administering it.</p>

<p>2. As to the cause of death.</p>

<p>A perusal of the summing-up from beginning to end impresses the mind
with the feeling that, whenever Mr. Justice Stephen approached any fact
offered by the defense which threw light upon <em>the possession</em> and <em>an
alleged</em> administration of arsenic by Mrs. Maybrick, he drew the minds
of the jury away from it; he played, in fact, the part of the peewit,
which swoops and screams in another part of the field on purpose to
hide where its nest is, and to draw the attention of the passers-by
from the right spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen pointed out to the jury in his summing-up:
&#8220;You must begin the whole subject of poison with this, which
is a remarkable fact in the case and which it seems to me tells
favorably rather than otherwise for the prisoner. You must take notice
of it and consider what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266"
id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> inference you draw from it. In the whole
case, from first to last, there is <em>no evidence</em> at all of her having
<em>bought</em> any poison, or definitely having had anything to do with
procuring any, with the exception of fly-papers. But there is evidence
of a considerable quantity having been found in various things, which
were kept some here and some there&mdash;kept principally, as I gather,
in the inner room.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a
href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ... There is evidence
about a considerable quantity of poison in this house, and more
particularly about one or two receptacles which were in the inner
room, Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s dressing-room, as it has been pointed
out.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s
Symptoms</span></h3>

<p>From the testimony it appears that on the 27th of April James
Maybrick, before starting to the Wirrall Races, was sick. There is no
actual evidence of vomiting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267"
id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> but he is described as sick, and as
feeling a numbness in his legs while walking downstairs, which was an
old-standing complaint of his of many years. Both he himself and Mrs.
Maybrick told the servants that this was due to a double dose of some
London medicine. He got wet through at the races and dined in his wet
clothes at a friend&#8217;s (Mr. Hobson), on the other side of the
Mersey, and did not return home till after the servants had retired
to bed; but the next morning, Sunday, the 28th of April, he was taken
ill, and Mrs. Maybrick sent a servant off hurriedly for Dr. Humphreys,
who had not attended her husband before, but who was the doctor living
nearest the house, and in the mean time got some mustard and water,
telling him to take it, as it would remove the brandy at all events.
Dr. Humphreys attended James Maybrick on the 28th, but was not told by
him that he had vomited the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen, when referring to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> this, said: &#8220;The
Wirrall Races were followed by symptoms which were described to be
arsenical.&#8221; It is submitted that this was a <em>misdirection</em>, the
symptom there referred to being sickness, and there was no evidence
of vomiting on any of the days immediately succeeding the Wirrall
Races. But on the 28th of April the mustard and water was given him
by Mrs. Maybrick for the purpose of <em>producing</em> sickness and removing
the brandy, and if he had been sick it would have been attributable to
<em>mustard and water</em>, not to arsenic.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the medical evidence showed that gastro-enteritis
might have been set up either by improper food or drink, or an excess
of either; or, again, by such a wetting through as deceased got at the
Wirrall Races. On the 8th of May Alice Yapp communicated to Mrs. Briggs
and Mrs. Hughes her suspicions that James Maybrick&#8217;s illness was
due to Mrs. Maybrick poisoning him with <em>fly-papers</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269"
id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s Access
to Poisons</span></h3>

<p>The purchase and soaking of fly-papers is the only direct evidence
of the possession of arsenic in any form by Mrs. Maybrick, but the
judge told the jury, and it is submitted it is a <em>gross misdirection</em>,
that Mrs. Maybrick &#8220;<em>undoubtedly had access to considerable
quantities of arsenic in other forms</em>,&#8221; inasmuch as the <em>only
evidence as to such access</em> was that after the death of James Maybrick
these two women, Mrs. Briggs and Alice Yapp, who exhibited the most
unfriendly feeling toward her, said they had found in the house certain
stores of arsenic.</p>

<p>It is submitted for the serious consideration of counsel that
the circumstances under which these two women produced these stores
of arsenic are so suspicious as to justify the suggestion that that
arsenic was not there before his death, and that Mrs. Maybrick never
did have any access to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270"
id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> or knowledge of it at all. There was
no evidence as to where or by whom this arsenic was obtained, nor was
there any evidence that the police had made any effort to discover
where, when, or by whom that arsenic was procured.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;How and when this arsenic
may have been procured by Mr. Maybrick himself will appear further on
as a part of the new evidence.]</p>

<p>The places in which arsenic was found were open and accessible to
every one in the house, and no person gave any evidence that he or she
had ever seen it in the house before these two women found it after
death.</p>

<p>As regards the black powder (arsenic mixed with charcoal) and the
two solutions of arsenic produced by Mrs. Briggs and Alice Yapp, Mr.
Davies, the analyst, gave evidence that, when analyzing the contents
of the various bottles, he had searched diligently and microscopically
for any traces, and could find no trace of charcoal having<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> been
introduced into any of them. So this circumstantial evidence may be
eliminated.</p>

<p>As regards white arsenic, also produced by these women, it must
be observed that not only was it not shown that Mrs. Maybrick had
purchased any, but it is submitted that the judge <em>ought to have
pointed out to the jury</em>, as the fact is, that it would have been
almost impossible for her or any woman to have obtained any white
arsenic at all. No shopkeeper dare sell it to any one except to a
medical man, and even then under the stringent restrictions of the Sale
of Poison Act.</p>

<p>At the trial a wholesale druggist (Thompson, of Liverpool) gave
evidence that James Maybrick constantly visited his cousin, who had
been in his employment at his stores, where he could have obtained
white arsenic from him without any difficulty; and it will be observed
that it was found in his hatbox.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable thing in this connection that, while Edwin
Maybrick called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272"
id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> police in on Sunday night, and gave them
the black solutions and white solutions which Mrs. Briggs had found on
the Sunday morning, he did not give them the black powder which Alice
Yapp had found on the-night before; and, in fact, that Michael Maybrick
did not give it to the police until Tuesday, the 14th.</p>

<p>It is also a remarkable fact that, although these black solutions
and that white solution of arsenic and that solid arsenic which Mrs.
Briggs had found, were not handed by the police to the analyst until
several days afterward, and were therefore <em>not known to be arsenic
by anybody, yet Mrs. Briggs was able to inform Mrs. Maybrick on
Tuesday, the 14th, as was testified to, that these bottles contained
arsenic</em>.</p>

<p>It is submitted that Mrs. Briggs could not have known that without
some other means of knowledge than looking at them.</p>

<p>The importance of this <em>misdirection</em> of the judge as to the
question of possession of arsenic by Mrs. Maybrick can not be<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
overstated. It was <em>conclusively</em> shown that no decoction of fly-papers
or of the black powder was the source of the arsenic with which certain
articles found in the house and office were said to be infected,
because the analyst said he had searched for the fibers of the papers
and for the charcoal, <em>and could not find any traces of either</em>. If
Mrs. Maybrick knew of the pure arsenic, why should she have bought the
fly-papers, either for a cosmetic purpose or murder, and what should
she have wanted with &#8220;poison for cats?&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to &#8220;Traces&#8221; of Arsenic</span></h3>

<p>Out of the list submitted by the police, therefore, the only two
things which could have been the source of the arsenic were the bottle
of saturated solution, No. 10 in the Police List, and the bottle of
solid arsenic, No. 11 in the Police List.</p>

<p>It may be observed that if all the arsenic or &#8220;traces&#8221;
of the same, with which various<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> things were said to be
infected, were collected together, it would not constitute a fatal
dose, the smallest fatal dose recorded being two grains, and this in
the case of a woman, and surely not in the case of a person addicted to
large doses of arsenic.</p>

<p>At the inquest Mr. Davies defined what he meant by the word
&#8220;trace.&#8221; He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It means something under 1/100 part of a grain. It does not
mean something which I could not weigh, but something which I could
<em>not</em> guarantee to be absolutely free from other things; but anything
under 1/100 part of a grain I should not consider satisfactory. If I
said <em>distinct traces</em>, I should say it meant something between 1/100
and 1/1000 part of a grain, while a <em>minute trace</em> is less than 1/1000
part of a grain.&#8221;</p>

<p>In reference to Reinsch&#8217;s test which Mr. Davies used in these
experiments, this passage occurs in Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Medical
Jurisprudence,&#8221; vol. i., p. 268: &#8220;The mere presence
of a gray deposit on pure copper affords <em>no absolute proof</em> of
the presence of arsenic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275"
id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> Bismuth, antimony, and mercury all yield
deposits with Reinsch&#8217;s test. The gray deposit of bismuth may
easily be taken for arsenic.&#8221; And again: &#8220;The errors into
which the faulty methods of applying Reinsch&#8217;s test lead have led
its reliability to be much discredited, and, although in skilful hands
the results are trustworthy, it would be perhaps unsafe to rely upon it
in an important criminal investigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that the evidence relating to the articles which
Mr. Davies said were infected with arsenic only to the extent of <em>an
unweighable trace</em> could not and ought not to be regarded as proof
that any arsenic at all was there, or as being anything more <em>than a
suspicion</em> upon this analyst&#8217;s mind that what he saw was arsenic,
and that it was a <em>misdirection</em> on the part of Mr. Justice Stephen
to treat a mere expression of opinion of that kind as proof of the
presence of arsenic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Arsenic in Solution</span></h3>

<p>It will be observed that the only things of which James Maybrick
could have partaken [but did not], in which arsenic in a weighable
form was present, were the bottle of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice and
the pot of glycerin, and that the arsenic found in them was found in a
state of solution.</p>

<p>As regards the half grain of arsenic found in the <em>meat juice</em>,
scientific evidence will be forthcoming that it is a physical
impossibility for any person to dissolve half a grain of solid arsenic
in 411 grains of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice, which is all the liquid
that was in the bottle when it was handed to Mr. Davies.</p>

<p>Mr. Davies, moreover, found that (although he used very loose and
unscientific language in his evidence) the specific gravity of the meat
juice was considerably reduced, thereby showing that the half grain
of arsenic found in it had been introduced in the form of <em>arsenic in
solution</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"
id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>It will now be observed that the <em>only arsenic in solution</em> which
was <em>available</em>, among the stores of arsenic found in the house, was
the <em>bottle No. 10</em> in the police list, and it is submitted that bottle
No. 11 (solid arsenic) must, like the black solutions, <em>be eliminated</em>
from any store of arsenic which Mrs. Maybrick, whether she had access
to it or not, could have employed for the purpose of infecting any of
the things found in the house to be infected.</p>

<p>Mr. Davies described the bottle No. 10 as a saturated solution of
white arsenic, and he stated that it had been dissolved with water,
some of the crystals remaining at the bottom undissolved.</p>

<p>At the inquest he stated, in reply to a question by the coroner:
&#8220;The bottle No. 10, which was also in the box, contained a
saturated solution of arsenic and solid arsenic at the bottom. There
was no label on it. It contained, solid and liquid, perhaps two
grains&mdash;a grain at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>So it is evident that there was not a fatal<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> dose
even in the stores which Mrs. Maybrick could have used had she had
access to it.</i></p>

<p>As regards this bottle, Mr. Justice Stephen told the jury: &#8220;A
saturated solution is a solution which has taken up as much arsenic
as it can, the water becoming saturated with arsenic; the remainder
of the arsenic is found at the bottom. In this case there was a
saturated solution of arsenic in the water and a small portion of
arsenic at the bottom. With regard to that these questions arise:
What was it for? Who is wanting such a quantity of strong solution
of arsenic? Who has put it there and how is it to be used? These are
the questions, in the solution of which I can not help you. There is
nothing definite about it to connect Mr. Maybrick with it certainly.<a
name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If he was in the habit of arsenic eating he
would not keep it saturated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279"
id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> water in quantities he could not
possibly use.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Davies found that this bottle &#8220;contained in solid and
liquid perhaps two grains&mdash;a grain at all events.&#8221; Now
arsenic can be dissolved in water by two processes. In cold water by
shaking it constantly for several hours (and the strongest solution
that can be obtained by the cold-water process is a one-per-cent.
solution, which is no stronger than the ordinary Fowler&#8217;s
solution as sold in the shops). That is called a &#8220;saturated
solution&#8221; by the cold-water process. A solution of three or
even four per cent. can be obtained with boiling water, but only when
the water is kept on the constant boil for several hours; and that is
also called a &#8220;saturated solution,&#8221; so that the phrase
&#8220;saturated solution&#8221; may mean either a weak solution of
one per cent., such as is gained by the cold-water process, or a
stronger solution of three per cent. by the boiling-water process,
and Mr. Justice Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280"
id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> <em>misdirected</em> the jury as to the meaning
of the phrase &#8220;saturated solution.&#8221; He should have told
them that a &#8220;saturated solution&#8221; of arsenic is one which
has by any particular process taken up as much arsenic and <em>retained
it in solution</em> as is possible by that particular process, and that it
might consequently be either a weak or a stronger solution, according
as it has been dissolved by the cold-water or boiling-water process, by
shaking for hours or boiling for hours.</p>

<p>The questions put to the jury by Mr. Justice Stephen upon the
interpretation of the phrase &#8220;saturated solution&#8221; which
he gave, namely, &#8220;How is it to be used?&#8221; &#8220;Who is
wanting such a quantity of <em>strong</em> solution of arsenic?&#8221; are
<em>misdirections</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Clayton&#8217;s Experiments</span></h3>

<p>Counsel are referred to experiments made with solutions of
arsenic by Mr. E. Godwin Clayton, of the firm of Hassall &amp;<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Clayton. From these it will be seen that by the experiment there marked
B, where the arsenic was shaken at intervals of twenty minutes for six
hours, the result shows that it would require 186&frac12; grains of
water to carry half a grain of arsenic. And that by experiment C, which
is the strongest possible solution by the cold-water process, namely,
one-per-cent. strength (equal to Fowler&#8217;s solution), it would
require 50 grains of water to carry half a grain, but to obtain this
the arsenic has to be shaken with cold water <em>at frequent intervals for
four days</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Godwin Clayton, in his report as to these experiments, remarks:
&#8220;I think, however, that as few people outside a chemical
laboratory would have the patience or opportunity to make a solution by
shaking it at short intervals during four days, the solution obtained
in experiment B&mdash;namely, an arsenical strength of 0.268 per
cent.&mdash;might be described in a popular<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> sense, though not
with strict scientific accuracy, as &#8216;saturated solution of
arsenic.&#8217;&#8221; But then if that be so, that is only about a
quarter of the strength of Fowler&#8217;s solution! The evidence of Mr.
Davies as to the specific gravity of the meat juice being considerably
reduced ought, it is submitted, <em>not</em> to have been received as
scientific evidence, and it was a <em>misdirection</em> to treat it as
such, because without the slightest difficulty, as will be seen by a
reference to Mr. Godwin Clayton&#8217;s experiments, Mr. Davies&#8217;s
evidence ought to have been scientifically exact, because he could have
shown that (for example) if a solution of the strength of experiment
B had been used, the 411 grains of liquid would have contained
186&frac12; of solution of arsenic and 244&frac12; grains of meat
juice; and, further, that the specific gravity of the meat juice
would, in that case, have been lowered from 1.2143 to 1.1263; and it
was, therefore, not only possible, but the duty of Mr. Davies, as an
expert, to have shown, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> comparing the specific gravity of the
bottle No. 10 and the specific gravity of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice,
that the &#8220;arsenic in solution&#8221; which had been introduced
into it had been introduced into it out of that particular bottle, No.
10.</p>

<p>Then, again, it will be seen from these experiments of Mr. Godwin
Clayton that if the solution in bottle No. 10 had been a strong
hot-water solution of three per cent., the specific gravity would not
have been considerably reduced, because the meat juice would in that
case have contained only 15&frac12; grains of arsenical solution.
To have obtained such a solution, the &#8220;arsenic powder&#8221;
must have been boiled with distilled water for four hours; and it is
submitted that it would have been <em>impossible</em>, in the first place,
for Mrs. Maybrick, or any person outside a laboratory, to have adopted
such a process of dissolving arsenic without the knowledge of the
servants or anybody else; and, further, that even if she could have
done this, she could not have possibly<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> weighed out exactly half
a grain of it, which is what Mr. Davies found; and it is suggested
that the only way in which that half grain of arsenic could possibly
have been measured into that bottle, must have been by introducing
Fowler&#8217;s solution, <em>and no Fowler&#8217;s solution was found in
the house</em>&mdash;and in no way was it suggested that Mrs. Maybrick had
any access to any, though others in that house may have been able to
procure such a medicinal dose of it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Arsenic in
Glycerin</span></h3>

<p>As regards the glycerin, Inspector Baxendale said he found this
bottle in the lavatory on the 18th of May. There was no evidence that
this bottle had ever been in Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s hands, and there was
no evidence that any part of it had been used by James Maybrick. There
was evidence that it was a freshly opened bottle. Scientific evidence
will be forthcoming that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285"
id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> <em>an absolute impossibility</em> for any
person to distribute arsenic evenly through a pound of glycerin.</p>

<p>It is suggested that there is no possible means by which that
glycerin could have been administered with a felonious intent to James
Maybrick; the mere moistening the lips with small quantities of it
could not have operated in that way.</p>

<p>Scientific evidence will be forthcoming that glycerin, when kept in
glass bottles, generally does contain arsenic, which it extracts from
the glass of the bottle.</p>

<p>In 1888 Jahns drew attention to arsenic being present in
glycerin&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chemische Zeitung</i>.</p>

<p>In 1889 Vulpius also drew attention to it&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Apotheker
Zeitung</i>.</p>

<p>Siebold (see <cite>Pharmaceutical Journal</cite>, 5th October, 1889) said, at
the Pharmaceutical Conference, on the 11th September, 1889, that his
experiments were made with toilet and pharmaceutical glycerin, and that
the majority showed presence of arsenious<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> acid, varying from 1
grain in 4,000 to 1 grain in 5,000.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out that this is <em>a larger quantity</em> than Mr.
Davies found, which was only &#8220;about 1/10 of a grain in 1,000
grains.&#8221;</p>

<p>The evidence relating to the administration of glycerin was that of
Nurse Gore and Nurse Callery, and was to the effect that on Thursday
night they refreshed James Maybrick&#8217;s mouth with <em>glycerin and
borax mixed in a saucer</em> that was on the table in the sick-room, and
that Mrs. Maybrick had brought the glycerin that was used either from
the medicine cupboard in her room or from the washstand drawer.</p>

<p>The attention of counsel is called to the fact that this saucer
of mixed glycerin and borax which was actually used <em>was not
produced</em> at the trial, but Justice Stephen, when summing up to the
jury, said: &#8220;Then you get the <em>blue</em> bottle which contained
Price&#8217;s glycerin. Here is the bottle, which there is no
evidence to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287"
id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> Mrs. Maybrick had even seen or touched;
a considerable portion is still left. That glycerin was found in the
lavatory outside, and if the bottle were filled and the same proportion
of arsenic added, there would be two-thirds of a grain of arsenic in
it. You have heard already that his mouth was moistened with glycerin
and borax apparently the night before he died. If that be so, and the
glycerin be really poison, it is certainly a very shocking result to
arrive at.&#8221; Sir Charles Russell: &#8220;I think the evidence of
Nurse Gore is that the bottle that was used the night before was taken,
not from the lavatory, but from the cupboard of the washstand.&#8221;
His Lordship: &#8220;It does not follow that that was the same
bottle. One does not know the history of that bottle or where it
went to. It may or may not have been the glycerin which was used for
the purpose I have mentioned, namely, for moistening the lips. But
it does appear in the case that a bottle was found in the lavatory,
and that it contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288"
id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> a grain of arsenic, and that his mouth
was moistened with glycerin and borax during the night in question; but
the identity between that bottle and the bottle which contained the
glycerin is not established and not proved.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that the above was an <em>unfair and
inflammatory suggestion</em>, and amounts to a gross <span
class="smcap">MISDIRECTION</span>, especially after all the evidence
about the condition of deceased&#8217;s tongue and his complaining of a
sensation as of a hair in his throat.</p>

<p>This concludes the whole of the evidence to any articles containing
arsenic which were found in the house, in which the arsenic was present
in anything except as <em>unweighable &#8220;traces.&#8221;</em></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Evidence of
Physicians</span></h3>

<p>Justice Stephen further summed up: &#8220;The witness
(Dr. Stevenson) stated: &#8216;I should say more arsenic
was administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289"
id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> on the 3d of May.&#8217;&#8221; It will
be seen, by a reference to Dr. Stevenson&#8217;s evidence, that Dr.
Stevenson <em>did not</em> say this.</p>

<p class="center noindent">HON. JOHN HAY,<br />

</div>

<p>Dr. Humphreys was the only medical man in attendance at that time.
The only symptoms on Friday, the 3d, were that he had &#8220;vomited
twice.&#8221; At the inquest Dr. Humphreys said as to this:</p>

<p>Q. &#8220;Did he say anything about his lunch on the previous day,
Thursday, the 2d?&#8221;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;Yes; he said some inferior sherry had been put into it,
and that it had made him as bad as ever again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that also appears in Dr. Stevenson&#8217;s evidence at the
trial:</p>

<p>&#8220;He told the doctor he had not been well since the previous
day, when I learn he had his lunch at the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>It can not be suggested that the fact that the man vomited
twice on Friday night was attributable to any arsenic taken
at midday on Thursday, for Dr. Stevenson testified that the
vomiting, which is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290"
id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> symptom of arsenic, usually follows the
administration in about <em>half an hour</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. Carter, who was not called in to the patient until Tuesday, May
7th, in his evidence, however, suggested that:</p>

<p>&#8220;I judge that the fatal dose must have been given on Friday,
the 3d, but a dose might have been given after that. When he was so
violently ill on the Friday, I thought it would be from the effects
of the fatal dose, but there might have been subsequent doses&#8221;;
and in cross-examination he explained that he had made this suggestion
about the fatal dose because: &#8220;I was <em>told</em> he was unable to
retain anything on his stomach for several days.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that the judge, when summing up, <span
class="smcap lowercase">MISDIRECTED</span> the jury by ignoring entirely the
evidence and substituting for it this reckless suggestion of Dr.
Carter&#8217;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Times When Arsenic May Have
Been Administered</span></h3>

<p>The only occasions on which it was possible to suggest any act of
administration of arsenic were the medicine on the 27th of April and
the food at the office on May 1st and May 2d; and the judge told the
jury:</p>

<p>&#8220;The argument that the prisoner administered the arsenic
is an argument depending upon the combination of a great variety of
circumstances of suspicion. The theory is that there was poisoning
by successive doses, and it is rather suggested that there may have
been several doses. But I do not know that there was any effort
made to point out the precise times at which doses may have been
administered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it is submitted that the statement
of the judge as to the medicine on the 27th of April, and as to
the food at office, and as to the statement that &#8220;Friday
(3d May) was the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292"
id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> on which began the symptoms of what may
be called the fatal dose,&#8221; <em>are misdirections of vital importance
to this case</em>, and such as to entitle Mrs. Maybrick to have the verdict
set aside and have a new trial ordered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s
Changing Medicine Bottles</span></h3>

<p>As regards the question of attempts to administer arsenic, the
occasions upon which such conduct was imputed are changing medicine
from one bottle into another and the Valentine&#8217;s meat juice. As
regards the changing the bottle, there were two occasions when evidence
was given as to Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s doing this. The first was on the
7th of May, when Alice Yapp said that some of the medicines were kept
on a table near the bedroom door and some in the bedroom, and that on
Tuesday, 7th of May, she saw Mrs. Maybrick on the landing near the
bedroom door, and what was she doing? She was<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> apparently pouring
something out of one bottle into another. They were medicine
bottles.</p>

<p>That is the whole evidence as to the incident, and as all the
bottles in the house were analyzed, and none found to contain
<em>even a trace of arsenic</em> except the Clay and Abraham&#8217;s
bottle&mdash;which James Maybrick was not taking at that time&mdash;the
judge could not properly direct the jury to regard it as a matter of
suspicion; <em>but he did do so</em>. He referred to this incident thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 28th April (the day after the Wirrall Races) Mrs.
Maybrick sent for Dr. Humphreys, and afterward she was seen pouring
medicine from one bottle into another.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that this was <em>a serious misdirection</em>.</p>

<p>The other occasion was on Friday, the 10th of May, when
Michael Maybrick, seeing Mrs. Maybrick changing a medicine from
one bottle to another in the bedroom, took the bottles away and
had the prescription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"
id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> made up again, saying: &#8220;Florrie,
how dare you tamper with the medicine?&#8221; Mrs. Maybrick explained
that she was only putting the medicine into a larger bottle because
there was so much sediment. Nurse Callery was present and there was
no concealment about what she was doing, and the bullying conduct
of Michael was absolutely without any sort of justification. <em>These
bottles were analyzed and found to be harmless.</em></p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen turned this incident, which occurred on
the afternoon before death, and after she had been prevented from
attending on her husband, against Mrs. Maybrick, thus&mdash;quoting
Michael&#8217;s evidence: &#8220;In the bedroom I found Mrs.
Maybrick pouring from one bottle into another and changing the
labels, and I said, &#8216;Florrie, how dare you tamper with the
medicine?&#8217;&#8221; And Justice Stephen continued: &#8220;Verily,
this was a strange&mdash;I don&#8217;t say strange considering
the circumstances&mdash;but dreadfully unwelcome remark to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> make
to a lady in her own house, when she was in attendance on her husband,
and something which showed the state of feeling in his mind, and must
have attracted her attention.&#8221; It is submitted that this was a
<em>misdirection</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Administration With Intent
to Kill</span></h3>

<p>There was also an attempt by the prosecution to suggest an attempt
to administer medicine, arising out of an occasion when James Maybrick
said to her, &#8220;You have given me the wrong medicine again,&#8221;
from which it appears that on the Friday, the day before death, Mrs.
Maybrick was not giving him anything at all, but was trying to get him
to take some medicine from Nurse Callery, who was endeavoring to induce
him to take it. This was one of the medicines ordered by Dr. Humphreys,
<em>and was found free from arsenic</em>. The <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>judge did not refer to
this in his summing-up,<br /> <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">but
reference to it is introduced here</span><br /> because it exhausts
the whole evidence, with the exception of the Valentine&#8217;s meat
juice incident, as to any suggestions or even of any occasions of
attempt to administer, while Mr. Matthews advised the Queen that
&#8220;the evidence leads clearly to the conclusion that the prisoner
administered and attempted to administer arsenic to her husband with
intent to murder,&#8221; which formed his ground for consigning this
woman to penal servitude for life. <em>No evidence, either of any act
of administration or of any act of attempt to administer either with
or without felonious attempt, was given at the trial, which possibly
could have led any person to any such conclusion</em>, with the single
exception of the Valentine&#8217;s meat juice; and as none of that
was administered after it had been in Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s hands,
the utmost that could be said of it (assuming that she did put any
arsenic into it) is that it was an <em>attempt</em> to administer, either
feloniously or otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297"
id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> It is submitted that the judge
<em>misdirected</em> the jury as to this incident, in that he did not tell
them that the mere evidence of an attempt to administer arsenic was
not sufficient&mdash;that they must be satisfied that the attempt to
administer was with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens rea</i> and with an intent to murder.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Exclusion of Prisoner&#8217;s
Testimony</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Maybrick voluntarily told her solicitors, Mr. Arnold and Mr.
Richard Cleaver, directly she was arrested and even before the inquest,
that she had, at her husband&#8217;s urgent request, put a powder into
a bottle of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice, but that she did not know,
until Mrs. Briggs informed her that arsenic had been found in a bottle
of meat juice, that the powder she had put in was assumably arsenic.
[At the trial both Mr. Richard and Mr. Arnold Cleaver, her solicitors,
offered to give evidence to this effect, but Justice Stephen refused
to admit it.] She also tried to tell<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> Mrs. Briggs the same
thing, but the policeman stopped the conversation; and she also told
it to her mother on her arrival. Mrs. Maybrick made no attempt at
concealment about having put this powder in, although no one had seen
her do it, and her solicitors, instead of relying as a line of defense
on showing there was no &#8220;mens rea&#8221; in what she had done,
kept back her account of what she had done. At the trial, however,
after all the evidence for the prosecution had been concluded without a
single witness speaking of her having put anything into anything, she
<em>insisted</em> on telling the jury, as she had told her solicitors, that
she did put a powder into a bottle of meat juice, in accordance with
an urgent request of her husband&#8217;s, but that she did not know it
was arsenic. If she did not know, there was no &#8220;mens rea.&#8221;
Upon that evidence, and upon certain suspicious circumstances connected
with her conduct in taking the meat juice into the dressing-room
and replacing it in the bedroom, the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> judge, as it is
submitted, <em>misdirected</em> the jury in the following passage:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Michael Maybrick says: &#8216;Nothing was given to my
brother out of that.&#8217; That is to say, nothing was given to him
out of the bottle of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice, which undoubtedly
had arsenic in it. Its presence was detected, but of that bottle which
was poisoned he certainly had none. He had a small taste of it <em>before
it was poisoned</em>, given him by Nurse Gore.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that the words &#8220;before it was poisoned&#8221;
is <em>a gross misdirection</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection as to Identity of Meat-Juice
Bottle</span></h3>

<p>It may be convenient here to interpose the following remarks on
the subject of the identity of the bottle. Counsel will observe
that the judge referred to the evidence at the inquest and at the
magisterial inquiry, which, it is suggested, enables a reference to any
discrepancies in the evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300"
id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> of the witnesses on the three
occasions&mdash;inquest, magisterial inquiry, and trial.</p>

<p>The identity of the half-used bottle, which was found to contain
&#8220;half a grain of arsenic in solution,&#8221; with the bottle
which Mrs. Maybrick took into the dressing-room, was not proved. It was
assumed alike by the prosecution and the defense, and by Mrs. Maybrick
herself, <em>but it was not proved</em>. It was proved that there was another
half-used bottle, of which James Maybrick had partaken on Monday, 6th
of May, when Dr. Humphreys said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the Valentine&#8217;s meat juice had been taken, but
it did not agree with the deceased and made him vomit. Witness did not
remember him vomiting in his presence, but he complained of it. Witness
told deceased to stop the Valentine&#8217;s meat juice, and said he was
not surprised at it making Mr. Maybrick sick, as it made many people
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was, therefore, another half-used<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> bottle. The attention of
counsel is strongly directed to the question of the identity of this
half-used bottle.</p>

<p>Besides the one in which the arsenic was detected, there was another
half-used bottle produced at the trial, which was found by Mrs.
Briggs after death in one of James Maybrick&#8217;s hatboxes in the
dressing-room, together with the black solutions and white solutions of
arsenic, and this bottle was found free of arsenic.</p>

<p>As to the bottle which Mrs. Maybrick had in her hands on the night
of the 9th-10th of May, and which she took into the dressing-room, and
as to which she volunteered the statement that she had put a powder
in, as to which evidence was given by Nurse Gore, was thus voluntarily
corroborated by Mrs. Maybrick in her statement to the jury. From
this it appears that Nurse Gore, on her arrival for duty on Thursday
night, opened a fresh bottle of meat juice, which had been given to
her the night before by Edwin Maybrick, and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> gave the patient one
or two spoonfuls, and then placed it on the table, from which she
shortly afterward saw Mrs. Maybrick remove it and take it into the
dressing-room, the door of which was not shut, and then return with
it into the bedroom and replace it on the table. Nurse Gore thought
she did this in a stealthy way. It must be remembered that Nurse
Gore was naturally suspicious, as is shown by the fact that on two
previous occasions she suggested suspicions with regard to changes
in medicines by Mrs. Maybrick, which on analysis were proved to be
free from arsenic. When the patient, a short time afterward, awoke,
Mrs. Maybrick came into the bedroom again and <em>removed</em> the bottle
from the table and placed it on the washstand, where there were only
the ordinary jugs and basins, and there left it. Nurse Gore&#8217;s
usual suspicions were aroused and she gave the patient none of it,
nor did Mrs. Maybrick ask her to give him any. When Nurse Gore was
relieved by Nurse Callery the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303"
id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> next morning (Friday, the 10th), at 11
o&#8217;clock, she called her attention to it and asked her to take <em>a
sample of it</em>, which Callery did, and put it into an ordinary medicine
bottle, which Nurse Gore gave her for the purpose. Nurse Gore left
the bottle on the washstand where Mrs. Maybrick had placed it. Nurse
Gore did not mention the circumstance to Dr. Humphreys when he came
to see the patient at 8:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, nor to
Michael Maybrick, whose attention she directed to a bottle of brandy
instead, which on analysis was found harmless; and she then went into
Liverpool and saw the matron, and on her return to the house at 2
o&#8217;clock told Callery to throw away the sample in accordance with
the matron&#8217;s orders, which Callery did. The bottle in which that
sample was taken was not specially identified, though it must have
remained on the premises. It ought to have been produced, because, if
arsenic was detected in the sample, the bottle of Valentine&#8217;s
meat juice would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304"
id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> identified by that means, and it would
have been shown that the arsenic was in the meat juice which Mrs.
Maybrick had taken into the dressing-room. On the other hand, as all
the bottles which were in the house were analyzed and found free of
arsenic, there is negative evidence that there was no arsenic in the
sample taken.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection in Excluding Corroboration of
Prisoner&#8217;s Statement</span></h3>

<p>Now the serious, most serious, consideration of counsel is asked for
in comparing the evidence of these three witnesses&mdash;Gore, Callery,
and Michael Maybrick&mdash;as given at the coroner&#8217;s inquest,
as it appears in the coroner&#8217;s depositions, at the magisterial
inquiry, as it appears in the magistrates&#8217; depositions,
and as given at the trial. It will be seen that there are great
discrepancies as to the place in the room from which Michael Maybrick
took the half-used bottle in which Mr. Davies, the analyst,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
subsequently detected one-tenth of a grain of arsenic in solution.
It is suggested that Mr. Michael&#8217;s evidence at the inquest is
the true account of where he got the bottle, and that his evidence at
the trial is <em>cooked</em>, to suit the evidence of Gore, <em>and that the
identity of the bottle is not established</em>. The statement, which in
her statement to the jury Mrs. Maybrick said she was prevented by the
policeman from making to Mrs. Briggs, the moment that person told her
about arsenic being found in the meat juice, was communicated by Mrs.
Maybrick at once to her solicitors, Mr. Arnold and Richard Cleaver; and
it is submitted that it was a <em>misdirection</em> of the judge to exclude
their evidence in corroboration of such a material and important fact
in her favor, <em>and a misdirection in refusing to allow corroboration in
that way</em> of what was in evidence, and did corroborate it&mdash;thereby
constituting a matter which the jury should have had before them, as
having a bearing on her statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirections to Jury to Draw Illegal
Inferences</span></h3>

<p>The judge referred to the Valentine&#8217;s meat-juice incident, the
most vital point in the trial, in the following extraordinary manner at
the end of his summing-up:</p>

<p>&#8220;I may say this, however: supposing you find a man
dying of arsenic, <em>and it is proved</em> that a person put arsenic
in his plate, and if he gives an explanation which you do not
consider satisfactory&mdash;that is a very strong question to be
considered&mdash;how far it goes, what its logical value is, I am not
prepared to say&mdash;I could not say, and unless I had to write my
verdict I should not say how I should deal with the verdict; but being
no juryman, but only a judge, I can only say this, it is a matter for
your serious consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that this was a <em>gross misdirection</em> and
<em>a cruel taunt</em> to <em>drive the jury into finding a verdict</em>
against the prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307"
id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> upon that ground, <em>and it is submitted
that so monstrously unfair an utterance can not be found in the reports
of any summing-up by any judge in any criminal case</em>. See also another
<em>misdirection</em> where the judge read the examination of Nurse Gore and
omitted reference to the sample, but said of the bottle, &#8220;In
point of fact, <em>it remained where it was</em> until taken away by Mr.
Michael Maybrick,&#8221; when it is in evidence that Nurse Callery
had taken a sample of it during the eighteen hours it remained on the
washstand, and that others beside Mrs. Maybrick had access to it.</p>

<p>It is submitted that, apart from the question of the identity of the
bottle, there was no evidence, except Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s statement,
that she had put anything into the bottle, which justified Mr. Justice
Stephen in using the words, &#8220;He had a small taste of it <em>before</em>
it was poisoned,&#8221; inasmuch as, except Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s own
voluntary statement that she had put a powder into a bottle of meat
juice, there was nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308"
id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> show that the arsenic, detected by Mr.
Davies in the bottle he analyzed, had not been in the bottle when Edwin
Maybrick gave it to Nurse Gore and which she opened when she gave the
patient &#8220;one or two spoonfuls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another <em>misdirection</em> in reference to the meat-juice incident will
be found in the summing-up in the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;It has a sort of very remote bearing upon the statement which
she made on Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of &#8220;a sort of very remote bearing,&#8221; it was a
<em>matter of the greatest importance</em> that it should be shown that <em>at
the very instant</em> she heard that arsenic had been found in some meat
juice, before even the inquest, <em>and before any arsenic had been found
in the body</em>, she should have attempted to tell Mrs. Briggs that she
had put a powder into some meat juice, but did not know what it was;
and, in connection with this, the attention of counsel is called to
the fact that Mr. Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> Stephen <em>refused to allow evidence
showing that she had made this statement from the very first</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirections Regarding the Medical
Testimony</span></h3>

<p>As to the cause of James Maybrick&#8217;s death, there was a
most remarkable conflict of medical opinion. It was not until the
post-mortem examination, held on Monday, the 13th of May, by Drs.
Carter and Humphreys (the medical men who had attended the deceased
during his illness), and Dr. Barron, that the cause of death was
ascertained, and it was then found to be exhaustion, caused by
gastro-enteritis or acute inflammation of the stomach and intestines,
which, in their opinion, had been set up by an irritant poison, but
might have been set up by his getting wet through.</p>

<p>These doctors agreed that by the phrase &#8220;irritant
poison&#8221; they meant any unwholesome food or drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310"
id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the time of death the doctors, Messrs. Humphreys and Carter,
had supposed and treated the patient for dyspepsia, notwithstanding
that suggestions had been made to them by Michael Maybrick that the
patient was being poisoned; and they said in their evidence that <em>but
for the discovery of arsenic on the premises, they would have given a
certificate of death from natural causes</em>.</p>

<p>At the post-mortem examination they selected such portions of the
body for analysis as they considered necessary, including, among other
things, the stomach and its contents; and the analyst employed by the
police (Mr. Davies) <em>found no arsenic in the stomach or its contents</em>,
and was unable to discover any weighable traces of arsenic in any other
portions of the body.</p>

<p>About three weeks afterward the body was, by order of the Home
Secretary, exhumed, and fresh portions of it were taken for analysis,
some of which were examined by Mr. Davies and other parts<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> by
Dr. Stevenson, one of the Crown analysts.</p>

<p>In those portions taken at the exhumation, the total result of the
search for arsenic in the body was that Mr. Davies actually found
unweighable arsenic, 2/100 of a grain, in the liver, and Dr. Stevenson
76/1000 of a grain in the liver and 15/1000 in the intestines, making,
when all added together, the total amount as found by Mr. Davies and
Dr. Stevenson about one-tenth of a grain, made up of minute fractional
portions of one-hundredths and one-thousandths.</p>

<p>It was shown in evidence that the smallest fatal dose of arsenic
ever recorded was two grains, which was in the case of a woman, and who
presumably was not an arsenic-eater.</p>

<p>It was shown in evidence that in the year 1888 Mrs. Maybrick had
asked Dr. Hopper (who was at that time, and had been for many years,
their regular medical attendant) to speak to Mr. Maybrick and prevent
him taking certain medicines, which were<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> doing him harm; that
early in March she made the same appeal to Dr. Humphreys, suggesting
at the time that Mr. Maybrick was taking a <em>white powder</em>, which she
thought was strychnin.</p>

<p>At the magisterial inquiry Dr. Humphreys stated that Mrs. Maybrick
had, on the occasion of his being called in to the patient on the
28th of April, also spoken to him about her husband taking this white
powder, and that in consequence of this he asked Mr. Maybrick about
taking strychnin and nux vomica.</p>

<p>Counsel will find proof, in the evidence given at the trial by Dr.
Hopper, Mr. Heaton, Nicholas Bateson, Esq., Capt. Richard Thompson,
Thomas Stansell, and Sir James Poole, ex-Mayor of Liverpool, as to the
arsenic habit of James Maybrick and his opportunities for obtaining
the drug. [To which must now be added the statutory declaration of
Valentine Charles Blake, son of the late Sir Valentine Blake, M.P.,
that he, about two months prior to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> Maybrick&#8217;s death,
had procured him 150 grains of arsenic.] It may be stated here that
from the appearance of the little bottles in which the white arsenic
was found, they had been in use for a long time and were such as would
be found as sample bottles in the offices of business houses to which
it is unlikely Mrs. Maybrick would have access.</p>

<p>It is submitted that the discovery of such a tiny quantity of
arsenic in the body of a man addicted to such extraordinary habits
might reasonably be accounted for by those habits.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Conflict of Medical Opinion</span></h3>

<p>The conflict of medical opinion which was exhibited on this trial
arose upon the point as to whether arsenic had been the cause of the
gastro-enteritis, of which it was admitted that the man died.</p>

<p>There was <em>no</em> conflict of medical opinion on the facts that
the quantity found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314"
id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> body <em>was insufficient to cause death</em>,
nor that gastro-enteritis might be set up by a vast variety of things
besides arsenic&mdash;in fact, by any impure food or by excessive
alcohol or by getting wet through. It was shown in evidence that Mr.
Maybrick got wet through at the Wirrall Races on the 27th of April, and
that he afterward went in his wet clothes to dinner at a friend&#8217;s
on the other side of the Mersey.</p>

<p>The conflict of medical opinion amounted to this, that the Crown
called Drs. Carter and Humphreys, who both admitted that <em>they had
never previously attended a case of arsenical poisoning, nor had
ever before attended a post-mortem examination of a person whose
death had been attributed to arsenic</em>&mdash;in short, that they had
had no experience whatever. The Crown also called Dr. Stevenson (who
had not attended the deceased, but had conducted the analysis of
parts of the body) as an expert in poisoning, and he said, as to the
symptoms during life: &#8220;<em>There is no distinctive diagnostic<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
symptom of arsenical poisoning.</em> The diagnostic thing is finding the
arsenic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Crown also had Dr. Barron, who had attended the post-mortem, and
who expressed himself unable to say that arsenic was the cause of the
gastro-enteritis.</p>

<p>These witnesses, it may be observed, gave their evidence both as to
the symptoms during life and as to the appearances at the post-mortem
<em>before</em> the medical evidence for the defense had been called.</p>

<p>The witnesses called for the defense had none of them attended the
deceased, but were called as experts in poisoning, viz., Dr. Tidy, a
Crown analyst, Dr. Macnamara, and Professor Paul, who all gave positive
evidence that neither the symptoms during life nor the appearance after
death were such as <em>could be attributed to arsenical poisoning</em>; that,
in fact, they pointed <em>away from</em>, instead of toward, arsenic being the
cause of death.</p>

<p>The evidence of these witnesses was<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> summarized very fairly
by Mr. Justice Stephen.</p>

<p>In the face of such a conflict of medical opinion, it is submitted
that Mr. Justice Stephen should have refused to allow the jury to
return any verdict of guilty at all.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirections as to Cause of Death</span></h3>

<p>On the first day of his summing-up, however, Mr. Justice Stephen
told the jury as to the law under which they were to return their
verdict: &#8220;You have been told that if you are not satisfied in
your minds about poisoning&mdash;if you think he died from some other
disease&mdash;then the case is not made out against the prisoner. It
is a necessary step&mdash;it is <em>essential</em> to this charge&mdash;that
the man <em>died of poison</em>, and the poison suggested is arsenic.
This is the question you have to consider, and it must be the
foundation of a judgment unfavorable to the prisoner that he died of
arsenic.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317"
id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>It is submitted that Mr. Justice Stephen <em>misdirected</em> the jury when
he told them to satisfy their minds whether he died from any other
disease, inasmuch as the only question before the jury was whether <em>the
cause of death was arsenic</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question for you is by what the illness was caused. Was
it caused by arsenic or by some other means?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that that is a <em>misdirection</em>. It might have been
put to a coroner&#8217;s jury, but it was not a question which should
have been put to a jury at a criminal trial.</p>

<p>It is submitted that he <em>misdirected</em> the jury in not also telling
them that it was <em>essential</em> to a verdict unfavorable to the prisoner
that the arsenic of which he died <em>had been administered by her</em>,
and also in not telling the jury that it was essential to a verdict
unfavorable to the prisoner that, if she had administered any, she had
done it with intent to destroy life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318"
id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misdirection to Ignore Medical
Testimony</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen then proceeded: &#8220;Now, let us see what the
doctors say. Some say death was caused by arsenic, and others that
it was not by arsenic&mdash;that he died of gastro-enteritis&#8221;;
and he spoke of the medical evidence in a way which amounted to a
direction to the jury that they were to treat it as <em>tainted with
subtle partisanship</em>, and as evidence to which it was not necessary
for them to attach <em>serious importance</em>. He, in fact, stated, and
in so doing <em>misdirected</em> the jury, that though it was essential
to a verdict unfavorable to the prisoner that he died of arsenic,
that question was one which they, the jury, could come to <em>their own
opinion about, without taking into consideration the opinion of the
medical experts, who had positively stated that arsenic was not the
cause of death</em>. In other words, he directed the jury that, as the
medical experts could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319"
id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> agree that the cause of death was
arsenical poisoning, it was for them to decide that question from their
own &#8220;<em>knowledge of human nature</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the second day of the summing-up the judge told the jury (and
it is submitted that it contains <em>gross misdirections</em>): &#8220;You
must consider the case as <em>a mere medical case</em>, in which you are to
decide whether the man did or did not die of arsenic according to
the medical evidence. You must not consider it as <em>a mere chemical
case</em>, in which you decide whether the man died from arsenic which was
discovered as the result of a chemical analysis. You must decide it
as <em>a great, high, and important case</em>, involving in itself not only
medical and chemical questions, but embodying in itself <em>a most highly
important moral question</em>&mdash;and by that term, moral question, I
do not mean a question of what is right and wrong in a moral point of
view, but questions in which human nature enters and in which <em>you
must rely on your knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320"
id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> of human nature</em> in determining the
resolution you arrive at.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, in the first place, to consider&mdash;far be it
from me to exclude or try to get others to exclude from their own minds
what I must feel myself vividly conscious of&mdash;the evidence in
this matter. I think every human being in this case must feel vividly
conscious of what you have to consider, but I had almost better say
you ought not to consider, for fear you might consider it too much,
the horrible nature of the inquiry in which you are engaged. I feel
that it is a dreadful thing that you are deliberately considering
whether you are to convict that woman of really as horribly dreadful
a crime as ever any poor wretch who stood in the dock was accused of.
If she is guilty&mdash;I am saying if my object is rather to heighten
your feeling of the solemnity of the circumstances, and in no way to
prevent you from feeling as you do feel, and as you ought to feel. I
could say a good many other things about the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> awful nature of the
charge, but I do not think it will be necessary to do any one thing.
Your own hearts must tell you what it is for a person <em>to go on
administering poison</em> to a helpless, sick man, upon whom she has
already inflicted a dreadful injury&mdash;an injury fatal to married
life; the person who could do such a thing as that must be destitute of
the least trace of human feeling.&#8221; And further on: &#8220;We have
to consider this not in an unfeeling spirit&mdash;far from it&mdash;but
in the spirit of people resolved to solve <em>by intellectual means an
intellectual problem of great difficulty</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen, in short, instead of putting to the jury for
separate answers each of the following three questions:</p>

<p>1. Did this man die of arsenic?</p>

<p>2. Did Mrs. Maybrick administer that arsenic?</p>

<p>3. Did she do it feloniously?</p>

<p>invited them to return a verdict of &#8220;guilty&#8221; or
&#8220;not guilty&#8221; upon a direction of law, wherein he
told them that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322"
id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> were to decide it as <em>an intellectual
problem</em>, on the question which, it is submitted, can be formulated
thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Might this man have died of arsenic notwithstanding the
opinion of the medical experts that he did <em>not</em> die of arsenic?&#8221;
And the jury answered &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is submitted that this was <em>a gross misdirection</em>.</p>

<p>It may be interesting and applicable to quote from a paper read
by Sir Fitzjames Stephen himself at the Science Association in 1884:
&#8220;It is not to be denied that, so long as great ignorance exists
on matters of physical and medical science in all classes, physicians
will occasionally have to submit to the mortification of seeing not
only the jury, but the bar and bench itself, receive with scornful
incredulity or with self-satisfied ignorance evidence which ought to
be received with respect and attention.&#8221; How prophetic this was
as exemplified by his own attitude in this trial need not be pointed
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323"
id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Misreception of Evidence</span></h3>

<p>Under the head of Misreception of Evidence may be classed the
observations of the judge, where, apparently in order to prevent
the jury from being influenced <em>in favor of the prisoner</em>, owing to
the small quantity of arsenic found in the body of the deceased, he
mentioned <em>an instance of a dog</em> being poisoned, in the body of which,
though it had taken a large number of grains of arsenic, no arsenic
was found after its death. The judge, in other words, turned himself
into a witness for the prosecution. The unfairness to the prisoner of
such a course is obvious. Had the judge been an ordinary witness he
might have been cross-examined to show, <i>e.g.</i>, that arsenic <em>passes
away from the body of a dog much more quickly than from that of a
man</em>, or that the circumstances as to time and quantity taken were
such as to prove that there was no analogy between the two cases. As
the matter stands, the judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324"
id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>&#8217;s recollection of an experiment
<em>on a dog</em>, which had been made many years before, was meant to rebut
a proposition much relied on by the defense, viz., that the small
quantity of arsenic found in the body of the deceased was consistent
with the view that he was <em>in the habit of taking arsenic</em>, rather than
with the case for the Crown that he had been intentionally poisoned.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cruel Misstatement by the Coroner</span></h3>

<p>The inquest was formally opened by taking the evidence of the
identification of the deceased by his brother, Michael Maybrick, and
then adjourned for a fortnight, the coroner announcing that there
had been a post-mortem examination by Dr. Humphreys, and that the
result of that examination was that poison was found in the stomach
of the deceased in such quantities as to justify further examination;
that the stomach of the deceased, and its contents, would meanwhile
be chemically analyzed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325"
id="Page_325">[325]</a></span> and on the result of that analysis would
depend the question whether or not criminal proceedings against some
person would follow. Now the announcement that &#8220;poison had been
found in the stomach of the deceased&#8221; was <em>contrary to fact</em>, and
in consequence of this <em>cruel misstatement</em> the proceedings caused an
immense amount of popular excitement and prejudice against the accused,
who, being too ill to be removed, remained at Battlecrease House, in
charge of the police, till the following Saturday morning, the 18th
May, when a sort of court inquiry was opened in Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s
bedroom by Colonel Bidwell, one of the county magistrates.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Evidence for the Prosecution</span></h3>

<p>The evidence of Dr. Arthur Richard Hopper, who had been Mr. and Mrs.
Maybrick&#8217;s medical adviser for about seven years, was taken.
He had not attended Mr. Maybrick during his last illness, but<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
spoke about Mrs. Maybrick having asked him the year before to check
her husband from taking <em>dangerous drugs</em>, and that Mr. Maybrick had
admitted to him that he used to dose himself with anything his friends
recommended, and <em>that he was used to the taking of arsenic</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Humphreys spoke as to the symptoms of the illness and
his prescriptions, and that he had not suspected poisoning until
it was suggested to him and his colleague, Dr. Carter, and that he
had <em>himself administered arsenic</em> to the deceased, in the form of
Fowler&#8217;s solution, on the Sunday or Monday before death, and that
he refused <em>a certificate of death only because arsenic had been found
on the premises</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. William Carter spoke of being called the Tuesday before death,
and he agreed with Dr. Humphreys that an irritant poison, most probably
arsenic, was the cause of death.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexander Barron gave evidence to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> the effect that he was
unable to ascertain <em>any particular poison</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Davies, the analyst, was called, and gave evidence to the
effect that he had found <em>no weighable arsenic</em> in the portions of the
body selected at the post-mortem, but that he had subsequently <em>found
one fiftieth of a grain of arsenic</em> in a part of the liver, nothing
in the <em>stomach or its contents, but traces, not weighable</em>, in the
intestines, and that he had found arsenic in some of the bottles and
things found in the house after death and in the Valentine&#8217;s meat
juice.</p>

<p>The first issue which the jury at the trial had to determine was
whether it was proved beyond <em>reasonable</em> doubt that the deceased died
from arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen, in his summing-up, put this issue to the jury
in the following words:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is <em>essential</em> to this charge that the man
<em>died</em> of arsenic. This question must be the foundation of a
verdict unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328"
id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> to the prisoner, that he <em>died of
arsenic</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It must be assumed that this was a question exclusively for medical
experts, notwithstanding which the judge, in summing up, told the
jury:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not consider this <em>as a mere medical case</em>, in which
you are to decide whether the man <em>did</em> or <em>did not die of arsenic
poisoning according to the medical evidence</em>. You must <em>not consider
it as a mere chemical case</em>, in which you decide whether the man
<em>died from arsenic which was discovered as the result of a chemical
analysis</em>. You must decide it as a <em>great and highly important case</em>,
involving in itself not only medical and chemical questions, but
involving in itself a most highly important <em>moral question</em>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Maybrick Died a Natural Death</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Humphreys gave it as his opinion that the appearances at the
post-mortem were <em>consistent with congestion</em> of the stomach<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> not
<em>necessarily caused by an irritant poison</em>, and that the symptoms
during life were also consistent with congestion not caused by an
irritant poison, but with acute inflammation of the stomach and
intestines, produced by any cause whatever, and which would produce
similar pathological results. He thought death was caused by some
irritant poison, most likely arsenic, but he <em>would not like to swear
that it was</em>. Dr. Humphreys&#8217; evidence, therefore, amounted
to this, that the deceased died from gastro-enteritis, a natural
disease, attributable to a variety of causes, and that, apart
from the suggestions already referred to, he would have certified
accordingly.</p>

<p>Dr. Humphreys&#8217; evidence was confirmed by that of Dr.
Carter, who stated he came to the same conclusion as Dr. Humphreys,
&#8220;but in a more positive manner.&#8221; Dr. Carter had
assisted at the post-mortem examination, besides being in close
attendance on the deceased for the five days preceding his death,
which he attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330"
id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> taking some irritant wine or decomposed
meat, or to some grave error of diet; and when pressed as to whether
he had any reason to suppose the article taken was poison, he
explained that he did, but that by poison he meant something that was
bad&mdash;it might be tinned meat, which the deceased had partaken of
at the race dinner, or wine, or something which had set up gastritis.
This witness&#8217;s account of the post-mortem was that they <em>found no
arsenic</em>, but merely evidence of an irritant poison in the stomach and
intestines, probably arsenic. Dr. Carter&#8217;s evidence was therefore
<em>against poisoning by arsenic</em> being conclusively accepted as the
cause of death, <em>although subsequently he said he had no doubt it was
arsenic</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. Barron&#8217;s evidence as to the cause of death was that he
considered from the post-mortem appearances that death was due to
inflammation of the stomach and bowels, due to some irritant poison,
but that he was unable to point to the particular poison,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> apart
from what he heard; and, pressed as to what he meant by poison, the
witness stated that poison might be bad tinned meat, bad fish, mussels,
or generally bad food of any kind, or alcohol taken in excess.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Chief Witness for the
Prosecution</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Stevenson expressed his opinion that the deceased died from
arsenic poisoning, giving as his reasons that the main symptoms were
those attributable to an irritant poison, and that they more closely
resembled those of arsenic than of any other irritant of which he
knew. He stated that he had known a great number of cases of poisoning
by arsenic in every shape, and that he acted officially for the Home
Office and Treasury in such cases. Dr. Stevenson was the witness of the
prosecution, and gave his evidence <em>before</em> he had heard the evidence
for the defense.</p>

<p>Dr. Stevenson also stated that the general<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> symptoms of arsenic
poisoning appeared <em>within half an hour</em> of taking some article of
food or medicine, and were nausea, with a sinking sensation of the
stomach; vomiting, which, unlike that produced by any ordinary article
of food or drink that disagrees, afforded as a rule no relief and
often came on again; that there was most commonly pain in the stomach,
diarrhea; after a time the region of the stomach becomes tender under
pressure, the patient becomes restless, often bathed in perspiration;
the throat is complained of; pain in the throat, extending down to
the stomach; the tongue becomes very foul in appearance and furred.
There is not a bad smell as in the ordinary dyspeptic tongue, a
rapid and feeble pulse, thirst, great straining at stool, vomits
and evacuations frequently stained with blood. Of fourteen symptoms
of arsenic poisoning named by Dr. Stevenson, Mr. Maybrick exhibited
<em>only one</em>, according to the testimony of Dr. Stevenson. With the
exception of the foul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333"
id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> tongue with malodorous breath, none of
these symptoms coincided with those given by Drs. Humphreys and Carter,
who were in attendance on the patient, while Dr. Stevenson <em>never saw
him</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Evidence for Defense</span></h3>

<p>Then came the evidence for the defense, rebutting the presumption
that death was caused by arsenic. First in order being Dr. Tidy, the
examiner for forensic medicine at the London Hospital, and also, like
Dr. Stevenson, employed as an analyst by the Home Office. This witness
stated that, within a few years, close upon <em>forty cases of arsenical
poisoning</em> had come before him, which enabled him to indicate the
recurring and distinctive indications formed in such cases.</p>

<p>Dr. Tidy describes the symptoms of arsenic poisoning as purging and
vomiting in a very excessive degree; a burning pain in the abdomen,
more marked in the pit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334"
id="Page_334">[334]</a></span> the stomach, and increased considerably
by pressure, usually associated with pain in the calves of the legs;
then, after a certain interval, suffusion of the eyes&mdash;the eyes
fill with tears; great irritability about the eyelids; frequent
intolerance of light.</p>

<p>Dr. Tidy added that there were three symptoms, such as cramps,
tenesmus, straining, more or less present, but the prominent symptoms
were those he had mentioned, especially the sickness, violent,
incessant sickness, and that poisoning by arsenic was extremely simple
to detect. Further, that he (Dr. Tidy) had known cases where one or
more of the four symptoms mentioned had been absent, but he had never
known a case in which all four symptoms were absent; and stated that he
had followed every detail of the Maybrick case so far as he could, and
had read all the depositions before the coroner and magistrate, and the
account of the vomiting did not agree with his description of excessive
and persistent vomiting, and was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> not that kind of
vomiting that takes place in a typical case of arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>Dr. Tidy further stated that, taking the whole of the symptoms,
they undoubtedly were <em>not</em> those of arsenical poisoning, nor did
they point to such, but were perfectly consistent with death from
gastro-enteritis, not caused by arsenical poisoning at all; and
that, had he been called upon to advise, he should have said it was
undoubtedly not arsenical poisoning, and that his view had been
very much strengthened, to use his own words, by the result of the
post-mortem, which distinctly pointed <em>away</em> from arsenic.</p>

<p>Then there was the evidence, in the same direction, of Dr.
Macnamara, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and its
representative on the General Medical Council of the Kingdom, which is
summed up in the general question put to him and his answer:</p>

<p>Question: Now, bringing your best judgment to bear on the
matter&mdash;you having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336"
id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> been present at the whole of this trial
and heard the evidence&mdash;in your opinion, was this death from
arsenical poisoning?</p>

<p>Answer: <em>Certainly not</em>.</p>

<p>In cross-examination Dr. Macnamara stated that, to the best of his
judgment, Mr. Maybrick died of gastro-enteritis, not connected with
arsenical poisoning, and which might have been caused by the wetting at
the Wirrall races.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul, professor of medical jurisprudence at University College,
Liverpool, and pathologist at the Royal Infirmary, stated he had made
and assisted at something like three or four thousand post-mortem
examinations, and that the symptoms in the present case agreed with
cases of <em>gastro-enteritis pure and simple</em>; that the finding of
the arsenic in the body, in the quantity mentioned in the evidence,
was quite consistent with the case of a man who had taken arsenic
medicinally, but <em>who had left it off for some time, even for several
months</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337"
id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Toxicological Study</span></h3>

<p>So positive were Dr. Tidy and Dr. Macnamara of their position as
to the effect of arsenic on the human system, that they subsequently
published &#8220;A Toxicological Study of the Maybrick Case,&#8221;
thus challenging medical critics the world over to refute them. From
this study the following, in tabular form, is taken, in order to
contrast the symptoms from which Mr. Maybrick suffered with those
which, it will be generally admitted, are the usual symptoms of
arsenical poisoning:</p>

<p class="p2">&#8220;Maybrick&#8217;s symptoms are as unlike poisoning
by arsenic <em>as it is possible for a case of dyspepsia to be. Everything
distinctive of arsenic is absent.</em> The urine contained no arsenic. The
symptoms are not even consistent with arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Regarding the treatment adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> the medical men, and
more especially Dr. Carter&#8217;s action with regard to the meat
juice, we are justified in assuming that the doctors themselves, even
<em>after</em> a certain suggestion had been made to them, did not come to the
conclusion that the illness of Maybrick was the result of arsenic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is noteworthy (1) that none was found in the stomach;
(2) that Maybrick was in the habit of taking drugs, and among them
arsenic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus two conclusions are forced upon us:</p>

<p>&#8220;(1) That the arsenic found in Maybrick&#8217;s body may have
been taken in merely medicinal doses, and that probably it was so
taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;(2) That the arsenic may have been taken a considerable
time before either his death or illness, and that probably it was so
taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our toxicological studies have led us to the three following
conclusions:</p>

<p>&#8220;(1) That the symptoms from which Maybrick suffered are
consistent with any form of acute dyspepsia, but that they point
<em>away</em> from, rather than toward, arsenic<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> as the cause of such
dyspeptic condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;(2) That the post-mortem appearances are indicative of
inflammation, but that they emphatically point away from arsenic as the
cause of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;(3) That the analysis fails to find more than <em>one-twentieth</em>
part of a fatal dose of arsenic, and that the quantity so found <em>is
perfectly consistent with its medicinal ingestion</em>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Medical Weakness of the
Prosecution</span></h3>

<p>Such was the complete evidence of the cause of death. The quantity
of arsenic found in the body was <em>one-tenth</em> of a grain, and upon
this evidence rests the first issue the jury had to consider, namely,
whether it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died
from arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>As to the value of the medical testimony on both sides, Dr.
Humphreys <em>admitted that he never attended a case of arsenical<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
poisoning in his life</em>, nor of any irritant poison, and that he would
have given a certificate of death from natural causes had he not been
told of arsenic found in the meat juice.</p>

<p>Dr. Carter laid <em>no claim to any previous experience of poisoning by
arsenic</em>, and was unable to say from the post-mortem examination that
arsenic was the cause of death, which he could only attribute to an
irritant of some kind, and he admitted that it was the evidence of Mr.
Davies, as to the finding of arsenic in the body, which led him to the
conclusion that arsenical poisoning had taken place.</p>

<p>Dr. Barron did not see the patient, but assisted at the post-mortem
examination, and stated that, judging by the appearances and apart from
what he had heard, he was unable to identify arsenic as the particular
poison which had set up the inflammation.</p>

<p>Now, assuming for a moment that this issue as to the cause of
death rested entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342"
id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> upon the uncontradicted testimony of
these three doctors called for the prosecution, Humphreys, Carter,
and Barron, the jury would not have been justified in coming to the
conclusion that there was <em>no reasonable doubt</em> that arsenic poisoning
was the cause of death. The doctors themselves had admitted that they
were unable to arrive at that conclusion, apart from the evidence that
arsenic was found in the body. <em>The idea of arsenical poisoning never
occurred to them from the symptoms, until the use of arsenic was first
suggested.</em></p>

<p><em>The doctors could not say that</em> death resulted from arsenic
poisoning, <em>and yet the jury have actually found that it did</em>, in the
face of the opinions of three eminent medical experts, who say it did
not.</p>

<p>Even if these doctors had never been called at all for the
defense, the jury were yet not justified in taking the evidence
of Drs. Humphreys, Carter, and Barron, in the terms which they
themselves never intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343"
id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> to pledge themselves to, namely, to
exclude <em>a reasonable doubt</em> that death was due to arsenic.</p>

<p>Let us consider the position of the medical men called for the
defense: Drs. Tidy, Macnamara, and Paul <em>are the highest authorities
on medical and chemical jurisprudence in Great Britain</em>. No sort of
hesitation or doubt attached to the opinions of any of them, and their
experience of post-mortem examinations was referred to, as including
in the practise of Dr. Tidy, the Crown analyst, some forty cases of
arsenic poisoning alone. Dr. Macnamara indorsed the opinion of Dr.
Tidy. In addition to that, there was on the same side the evidence
of Dr. Paul, professor of medical jurisprudence and toxicology at
University College, Liverpool, with an experience of three or four
thousand post-mortem examinations. It is impossible to conjecture
<em>by what process of reasoning</em> the jury could have come to the
conclusion, upon the evidence before them, that it <em>was beyond a<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
reasonable doubt that Mr. Maybrick</em> had met his death by arsenical
poisoning.</p>

<p><em>This volume of evidence before the jury pointed not only to a
doubt as to the cause of death, but to a reasonable</em> conclusion that
it was <em>not due to arsenical poisoning. It is inconceivable that the
jury should have</em> found as they did, <em>except under the mandatory
direction of the judge, which left them apparently no alternative but
to substitute his opinions and judgment for</em> their own, so that on
that <em>issue the finding was not so much the finding of the jury, to
which the prisoner was by law entitled, but the finding of</em> the judge,
<em>of whom the jury, abrogating their own functions, became the mere
mouthpieces</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Administration Of Arsenic</span></h3>

<p>The consideration of the facts as given in evidence also
covers the second issue which the jury had to determine, namely,
whether, if arsenic poisoning was the cause of death, it was the
prisoner who administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345"
id="Page_345">[345]</a></span> it with criminal intent. The evidence on
this point was most inconclusive.</p>

<p><em>No one saw the prisoner administer arsenic to her husband.</em></p>

<p>She had no opportunity of giving her husband anything since one or
two o&#8217;clock on Wednesday afternoon (8th of May), after which
she was closely watched by the nurses. <em>It was not shown that any
food or drink administered to the deceased by the prisoner contained
arsenic.</em> It was not shown that the prisoner <em>had placed arsenic in
any food or drink intended for her husband&#8217;s use</em>. Nor, in fact,
was any found, although searched for, in any food or medicine of
which Mr. Maybrick partook during his illness, <em>except the arsenic in
Fowler&#8217;s solution, prescribed and administered by Dr. Humphreys
himself</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Fly-paper Episode</span></h3>

<p>The episode of the fly-papers may be considered as one of the
most important factors in the whole case. It supplies, so<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> to
speak, the only link between Mrs. Maybrick and arsenic, which, it
is well known, forms their chief ingredient. It was proved she had
purchased the fly-papers without any attempt at concealment, and,
while soaking, they were exposed to everybody&#8217;s view, quite
openly, in a room accessible to every inmate of the house. It was
not suggested that Mrs. Maybrick bought the other large quantity of
arsenic, between seventy and eighty grains, found in the house after
death, <em>and no one came forward to speak to any such purchase</em>. It
was found in the most unlikely places for Mrs. Maybrick to have
selected, if she had intended to use it, and the evidence against her
on this point is of <em>a particularly vague and indefinite character</em>.
[Justice Stephen, commenting on the quantity of arsenic found on the
premises, himself observed that it was a remarkable fact in the case,
and which, it appeared to him, told most favorably than otherwise for
the prisoner, as in the whole case, from first to last, there<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span> was
no evidence at all that she had bought any poison, or had anything to
do with the procuring of any, with the exception of those fly-papers.]
The accusation rests entirely <em>on suspicion, insinuation, and
circumstantial suggestions; not one tittle of evidence was adduced
in support of it</em>, and yet the jury came to the conclusion, without
allowing of any doubt in the matter, <em>that it was her hand which
administered the poison</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How Mrs. Maybrick Accounts for The
Fly-Papers</span></h3>

<p>On this question the prisoner made a statement. She accounted
for the soaking of the fly-papers upon grounds which were not only
probable, but were corroborated by other incidents. That she was in
the habit of using arsenic as a face wash is shown by the prescription
in 1878, before her marriage, and of which the chemist made an entry
in his books, which came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348"
id="Page_348">[348]</a></span> light, after the trial, under the
following circumstances:</p>

<p>Among the few articles which Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s brothers
allowed to be taken from the house, they being the legatees of the
deceased, was a Bible which had belonged to Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s
father, and which, with some other relics, came into the hands of
Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s mother, the Baroness von Roques, who, months
afterward, happening to turn over the leaves of the Bible, came across
a small piece of printed paper, evidently mislaid there, being a New
York chemist&#8217;s label, with a New York doctor&#8217;s prescription
written on the back, for an arsenical face wash &#8220;for external
use, to be applied with a sponge twice a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>This prescription contained Fowler&#8217;s solution of arsenic,
chlorate of potash, rose-water, and rectified spirits; and was
again made up, on the 17th of July, 1878, by a French chemist, Mr.
L. Brouant, 81 Avenue D&#8217;Eylau, Paris. It corroborates Mrs.
Maybrick&#8217;s statement at the trial<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> that the fly-papers
were being soaked for the purpose alleged by her. If Mrs. Maybrick had
obtained or purchased the seventy or eighty grains of arsenic found in
the house after the death, it is inconceivable that she should have
openly manufactured more arsenic with the fly-papers. At the time she
prepared the statement she had reason to believe that the prescription
had been lost. She knew, therefore, it would be impossible for her to
corroborate her story about the face wash, and she could have omitted
that incident altogether, and contented herself by saying that she
learned the preparation while at school in Germany.</p>

<p>[In further explanation I desire to state that during my
girlhood, as well as subsequently, I suffered occasionally, due
to gastric causes, from an irritation of the skin. One of my
schoolmates, observing that it troubled me a good deal, offered me
a face lotion of her own preparation, explaining that it was much
more difficult to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350"
id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> an arsenical ingredient abroad than
in America, and to avoid any consequent annoyance she extracted the
necessary small quantity of arsenic by the soaking of fly-papers. I had
never had occasion to do so myself, as I had a prescription from Dr.
Bay; but when I discovered that I had mislaid or lost this, I recalled
the method of my friend, being, however, wholly ignorant of what
quantity might be required. The reason why I wanted a cosmetic at this
time was that I was going to a fancy dress ball with my husband&#8217;s
brother, and that my face was at that time in an uncomfortable state of
irritation.&mdash;F. E. M.]</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Administration of Arsenic not Proved</span></h3>

<p>Dealing with the question, did Mrs. Maybrick administer the arsenic,
there is absolutely no evidence <em>that she did. It was not for the
prisoner to prove her innocence.</em> She was seen neither to administer
the arsenic nor to put it in the food or<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> drink taken by the
deceased, and this issue was found against her in the absence of any
evidence in support.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Intent to Murder not Proved</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s statement also bears strongly upon the
question of administering with intent to murder. It is equally
inconceivable that a guilty woman would have said anything about the
white powder in the meat juice. She had nothing to gain by making such
a statement, which could only land her in the sea of difficulties
without any possible benefit, and here again the probabilities are
entirely in her favor. It is beyond a doubt that Mr. Maybrick was in
the habit, or had at some time or other been in the habit, of drugging
himself with all sorts of medicines, including arsenic, and assumably
he had obtained relief from it, or he would not have continued the
practise.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stephen, in his summing-up,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> animadverted in very
strong terms on the testimony of arsenic being used for cosmetic
purposes, although expert chemists had certified to large use of
arsenic for such a purpose. An immense degree of speculation must have
entered the minds of the jury before they could find as they did, and
bridge the gulf between the soaking of the fly-papers and the death
of Mr. Maybrick, for it is quite evident that the soaking of the
fly-papers was the one connection between the arsenic and the prisoner
upon which all the subsequent events turned; and, if that be so, the
importance is seen at once of the statement she made regarding that
incident, and conclusive evidence as to which was subsequently found in
the providentially recovered prescription.</p>

Of Hayden &amp; Yarrell, American counsel of Mrs. Maybrick.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Absence of Concealment by Prisoner</span></h3>

<p>Another remarkable circumstance is the absence of any attempt at
concealment on the prisoner&#8217;s part. The fly-papers were<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
purchased openly from chemists who knew the Maybricks well, and they
were left soaking in such a manner as at once to refute any suggestion
of secrecy; and her voluntary statement about the white powder which
she placed in the meat juice, as to which there was absolutely no
evidence to connect her with its presence there, seems inconsistent
with the theory the prosecution attempted to build upon <em>a number of
assumptions of which the accuracy was not proved</em>.</p>

<p>The question of the prisoner&#8217;s guilt was not capable of being
reduced to any issue upon which the prosecution could bring to bear
direct evidence; the most they were capable of doing was to show that
the prisoner had <em>opportunities</em> of administering poison, which she
<em>shared with every individual in the house</em>; further, that she had
arsenic in her possession (and this was an <em>open secret</em>, as we have
already explained with reference to the fly-papers); and, lastly,
that she had the possibility of extracting<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> arsenic in sufficient
quantities to cause death, which was, however, extremely doubtful;
and then the prosecution tried to complete this indirect evidence by
proving that Mr. Maybrick died from arsenic poisoning, <em>which they
signally failed to do</em>. The strong point of the prosecution, as they
alleged, was that a bottle of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice had been
seen in her hands on the night of Thursday, the 9th of May, and she
replaced it in the bedroom, where it was afterward found by Michael
Maybrick, and analyzed by Mr. Davis, who found half a grain of
&#8220;arsenic in solution&#8221;; but there was <em>no direct proof</em>,
such as is absolutely necessary to a conviction in a criminal case,
<em>of the identity of the bottle</em> seen in Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s hands
and that given to the analyst, and there was evidence that it had
remained in the bedroom <em>within reach of anybody, Mr. Maybrick himself
included</em>, for eighteen hours, and did not until the next day reach the
hands of the analyst. These bottles are all alike in appearance,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of similar turnip-like shape as the bovril bottles now sold, and it
is clear there was more than one, because Dr. Humphreys says in his
evidence that on visiting his patient on the 6th of May he found some
of the Valentine&#8217;s meat extract had made Mr. Maybrick sick, which
he was not surprised at, as it often made people sick; while Nurse
Gore, speaking of the bottle seen in the hands of Mrs. Maybrick, said
it was a <em>fresh, unused bottle</em>, which she had herself opened only an
hour before.</p>

<p>No evidence was given of what became of the opened bottle, and the
presence of the arsenic having already been accounted for, and the fact
recorded that the meat juice was not given to Mr. Maybrick, there is
nothing to add to what has already been said, except that the account
exactly dovetails with the prisoner&#8217;s own voluntary statement.</p>

<p>Can any one, closely following the evidence throughout,
fail to be impressed with the <em>inconsistency of Mrs.
Maybrick&#8217;s conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356"
id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> in relation to her husband&#8217;s
illness with a desire to murder him?</em> In all recorded cases of
poisoning, the utmost precautions to screen the victim from observation
have been observed. In the present instance it would seem as if just
the reverse object had been aimed at. We find the prisoner <em>first
giving the alarm about the attack</em> of illness; first sending for
the doctors, brothers, and friends; first suggesting that something
taken by her husband, some drug or medicine, was at the bottom of the
mischief. We find the very first thing she does is to administer a
mustard emetic&mdash;the last thing one would have expected if there
had been a desire to poison him. If the prisoner <em>had wished to put
everybody in the house, and the doctors themselves, on the scent of
poison, she could not have acted differently</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Important Deductions from Medical
Testimony</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> Dr.
Humphreys&#8217; testimony it appears that, after the days when he was
away from the patient, and when Mrs. Maybrick had undisturbed access to
her husband, <em>no symptoms whatever of arsenical poisoning appeared</em>.
If, then, arsenic was administered by Mrs. Maybrick under the
doctors&#8217; eyes, without their detecting it, <em>what value can attach
to the testimony of the medical attendants</em> as to the cause of death,
apart from the post-mortem examination, by which they practically admit
<em>they allowed their judgment to be governed</em>?</p>

<p>Does not the only alternative present itself that Drs. Humphreys
and Carter are driven to the admission: &#8220;That the deceased
died of arsenical poisoning we deduce, not from the <em>symptoms during
life</em>, but from the fact that <em>arsenic was found in the body after
death</em>&#8221;?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358"
id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Symptoms Due to Poisonous Drugs</span></h3>

<p>From the medical testimony it appears that the following list of
<em>poisonous drugs</em> was prescribed and administered to Mr. Maybrick
shortly before his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>April 28, 1899, diluted prussic acid; April 29, Papaine&#8217;s
iridin; May 3, morphia suppository; May 4, ipecacuanha; May 5, prussic
acid; May 6, Fowler&#8217;s solution of arsenic; May 7, jaborandi
tincture and antipyrin; May 10, sulfonal, cocain, and phosphoric
acid.</p>

<p>Also, during the same period, the following were prescribed:
bismuth, double doses; nitro-glycerin; cascara; nitro-hydrochloric acid
(composed of nux vomica, strychnin, and brucine); Plummer&#8217;s pills
(containing antimony and calomel); bromide of potassium; tincture of
hyoscyamus; tincture of henbane; chlorin.</p></div>

<p>Now it will be observed that up to May 6, when Fowler&#8217;s
solution of arsenic was administered, no symptom whatever had<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span> been
observed <em>at all compatible with the effects of arsenic</em>.</p>

<p>The sickness produced by the morphia continued after the taking of
arsenic, and down the unfortunate man&#8217;s throat prussic acid,
papaine, iridin, morphia, ipecacuanha, and arsenic, some of the most
powerful drugs known to the pharmacop&#339;ia, had found their way by
the advice of Dr. Humphreys, in less than a week, while he was told to
eat nothing, and allay his thirst with a damp cloth; and the charge of
poisoning is made against the prisoner because he is suggested to have
had an irritant poison in his stomach, and minute traces of arsenic in
some other organs, within five days afterward.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Death from Natural Causes</span></h3>

<p>The whole history of the case, from its medical aspect, is
consistent with the small quantity of arsenic found in the body being
part of that prescribed by Dr. Humphreys,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> or the remains of that
taken by the deceased himself, <em>there being no particle of evidence
to show that he discontinued the habit of drugging himself almost up
to the day of his death</em>. This is also in accord with the evidence of
Dr. Carter, who attended at a later period, and, taken as a whole, the
evidence of both of these doctors, as well as their treatment of the
deceased, points to <em>death from natural causes</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prosecution&#8217;s Deductions from Post-mortem
Analysis Misleading</span></h3>

<p>The evidence of the prosecution in connection with the analysis
was thoroughly <em>unreliable and misleading</em>. Dr. Stevenson&#8217;s
difficulty was that, while two grains of arsenic was the smallest
quantity capable of killing, the analyst had found only one-tenth of
a grain, or the twentieth part of the smallest fatal dose, and, in
substance, Dr. Stevenson proceeds to argue as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) I found 0.015 grain of arsenic in 8 ounces of intestines.
(There is no record as to what part of the intestines he examined.) I
have weighed the intestines of some other person (not Mr. Maybrick),
and find their entire weight to be so much. If, then, 8 ounces of Mr.
Maybrick&#8217;s intestines yield 0.015 grain, the entire intestines
(calculated from the weight of some one else&#8217;s intestines), had I
analyzed them, would have yielded one-eleventh of a grain.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Dr. Stevenson then proceeds to argue: &#8220;I found 0.026
grain of arsenic in 4 ounces of liver. The entire liver weighed
48 ounces, <em>therefore the entire liver contained 0.32 grain of
arsenic</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Dr. Stevenson argues further: &#8220;The intestines and liver,
therefore, may be taken to contain together four-tenths of a grain of
arsenic, and, having found four-tenths of a grain, I <em>assume</em> that
the body at the time of death <em>probably contained a fatal dose of
arsenic</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was the deduction Dr. Stevenson<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span> arrived at,
<em>necessitating the assumption that arsenic was equally distributed in
the intestines and liver</em>, whereas it is within the <em>personal knowledge
of eminent men</em> (such as Drs. Tidy and Macnamara) that arsenic may be
found after death <em>in one portion of the intestines, and not a trace
of it in any other part</em>. That in arsenical poisoning the arsenic may
be found in the rectum and in the duodenum, and in no other part, is
beyond dispute, and the <em>fallacy of Dr. Stevenson&#8217;s process must
be self-evident</em>.</p>

<p>The witnesses for the prosecution themselves supply the proof of the
unequal distribution of the arsenic in the liver.</p>

<p>Mr. Davies calculates the quantity in the whole liver as 0.130
grain.</p>

<p>Dr. Stevenson, in his first experiment, puts it at 0.312 grain,
and in his second experiment at 0.278 grain; in other words, Dr.
Stevenson finds <em>double in one experiment</em> and considerably <em>more
than double in another experiment, the quantity found by Mr. Davies,
and it is upon this glaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363"
id="Page_363">[363]</a></span> miscalculation and discrepancy that
the case for the prosecution was made</em> to rest, and Mrs. Maybrick was
convicted.</p>

<p>But with all this miscalculation the approximate amount of arsenic
<em>can only be swelled up to four-tenths of a grain, less than one-fourth
of a fatal dose</em>, and it was demonstrated that every other part of the
body, urine, bile, stomach, contents of stomach, heart, lungs, spleen,
fluid from mouth, and even bones, <em>were all found to be free from
arsenic</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Recapitulation Of Legal Points</span></h3>

<p>The legal points of the case may thus conveniently be recapitulated
under the following short heads:</p>

<p>There <em>was no conclusive</em> evidence that Mr. Maybrick died from other
than natural causes (the word &#8220;conclusive&#8221; being used in
the sense of <em>free from doubt</em>).</p>

<p>There was no conclusive evidence that he died from arsenical
poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364"
id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no evidence that the prisoner administered or attempted to
administer arsenic to him.</p>

<p>There was no evidence that the prisoner, if she did administer or
attempt to administer arsenic, did so with intent to murder.</p>

<p>The judge, while engaged in his summing-up, placed himself in a
position where his mind was open to the influence of public discussion
and prejudice, to which was probably attributable the evident change in
his summing-up between the first and second days; and he also <em>assumed
facts against the prisoner which were not proved</em>.</p>

<p>The jury were <em>allowed to separate</em> and frequent places of public
resort and entertainment during such summing-up.</p>

<p>The verdict was <em>against the weight of evidence</em>.</p>

<p>The jury <em>did not give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt</em>
suggested by the disagreement of expert witnesses on a material issue
in the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365"
id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>The Home Secretary should have remitted the entire sentence by
reason of his being satisfied that there existed a <em>reasonable doubt of
her guilt</em>, which, had it been taken into consideration at the time,
would have entitled <em>her to an acquittal</em>.</p>

<p>The indictment contained no specific account of felonious
administration of poison, and consequently the jury found the prisoner
guilty of an offense <em>for which she was never tried</em>.</p>

<h2 class="sub">Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s Own Analysis<br />

<span class="smcap f80">Of The Meat-Juice Incident</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot f90">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I said</span> in my statement
to the Court, regarding this meat juice, that: &#8220;On Thursday
night, the 9th, after Nurse Gore had given my husband beef juice, I
went and sat on the bed by the side of him. He complained to me of
feeling very sick, very weak, and very depressed, and again implored
me to give him a powder, which he had referred to early in the evening
and which I had then declined to give him. I was overwrought, terribly
anxious, miserably unhappy, and his evident distress utterly unnerved
me. He told me the powder would not harm him, and that I could put it
in his food. I then consented. My lord, I had not one true or honest
friend in the house. I had no one to consult and no one to advise me.
I was deposed from my position as mistress in my own house and from
the position of attending on my own husband, notwithstanding that he
was so ill. Notwithstanding the evidence of nurses and servants, I may
say that he wished to have me with him. [This desire was corroborated
by the testimony of Nurse Callery.] He missed me whenever I was not
with him. Whenever I went out of the room he asked for me, and for four
days before he died I was not allowed to give him even a piece of ice
without its being taken from my hand. When I found the powder I took it
into the inner room, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367"
id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> pushing through the door I upset the
bottle, and, in order to make up the quantity of fluid spilled, I added
a considerable quantity of water. On returning to the room I found my
husband asleep, and I placed the bottle on the table by the window.
When he awoke he had a choking sensation in his throat and vomiting.
After that he appeared a little better. As he did not ask for the
powder again, and as I was not anxious to give it to him, I removed
the bottle from the small table, where it would attract his attention,
to the top of the washstand, where he could not see it. There I left
it until I believe Mr. Michael Maybrick took possession of it. Until a
few minutes before Mr. Bryning made the terrible charge against me, no
one in that house had informed me of the fact that a death certificate
had been refused, or that a post-mortem examination had taken place,
or that there was any reason to suppose that my husband died from
other than natural causes. It was only when Mrs. Briggs alluded to the
presence of arsenic in the meat juice that I was made aware of the
[supposed] nature of the powder my husband had asked me to give him. I
then attempted to make an explanation to Mrs. Briggs, such as I am now
making to your lordship, when a policeman interrupted the conversation
and put a stop to it.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Some time after my conviction there was found among my effects
a prescription for a face wash containing arsenic (the existence
of which Justice Stephen in his summing up flouted as an invention
of mine to cover an intent to poison). This, together with the
fact that on analysis no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368"
id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> trace of &#8220;fiber&#8221; was
discovered in the body or in any of the things containing poison found
in the house, should remove the &#8220;fly-paper incident&#8221; from
all serious consideration in its bearing on the case (although it was
the source of all &#8220;suspicions&#8221; before death).</p>

Of Hayden &amp; Yarrell, American counsel of Mrs. Maybrick.</p>
</div>

<p>There remain only as &#8220;circumstantial evidence of guilt&#8221;
what has come to be known as the &#8220;motive,&#8221; and the
Valentine&#8217;s meat-juice incident. The &#8220;motive,&#8221;
however regarded, was surely no incentive to murder, as inasmuch if
I wanted to be free there was sufficient evidence in my possession
(in the nature of infidelity and cruelty) to secure a divorce, and it
was with regard to steps in that direction that I had already taken
that I made confession to my husband after our reconciliation, and
to which I referred as to the &#8220;wrong&#8221; I had done him,
because of the publicity and ruin to his business it involved. The
&#8220;motive,&#8221; which was introduced into the case in the form
of a letter written by me on the 8th of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> May, in which I said
that my husband was &#8220;sick unto death,&#8221; was made much of by
the prosecution, and it led Justice Stephen to say, in his summing-up,
&#8220;that I could not have known that my husband was dying (except
I knew something others did not suspect), inasmuch as the doctors,
from the diagnosis, did not consider the case at all serious.&#8221;
The justice either did not or would not understand (though it was
testified to) that the phrase, &#8220;sick unto death,&#8221; is
an American colloquialism, especially of the South, and commonly
employed with reference to any illness at all serious. Aside from the
fact that all in attendance (save and except the doctors per their
medical testimony) did regard it as serious&mdash;a witness for the
prosecution, Mrs. Briggs, testified that she regarded him on that
day as &#8220;dangerously ill,&#8221; and Mr. Michael Maybrick said
that when he saw his brother on the evening of the same day &#8220;he
was shocked by his appearance&#8221;&mdash;I may say here that the
phrase &#8220;sick unto death,&#8221; in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> connection with other
causes for apprehension, was prompted by the fact that my husband
had told me that very morning that &#8220;he thought he was going to
die&#8221;; and that this was his feeling is conclusively shown by the
evidence of Dr. Humphreys at the inquest, when he testified that he
had remarked to Mr. Michael Maybrick on this same Wednesday, the 8th
of May: &#8220;I am not satisfied with your brother, and I will tell
you why [not because the symptoms seemed serious to him, it will be
observed]. <em>Your brother tells me he is going to die.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>That I regarded the case as really serious is surely further
supported by the fact that, notwithstanding the easy-going attitude
of Dr. Humphreys, I had persisted in urging a consultation, which
accordingly took place on the 7th. As to what the attending physicians
<em>knew</em> or <em>did not know</em> about the medical aspects of the case, I
confidently refer the reader to their own remarkable testimony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371"
id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>There then remains for serious consideration only what is known as
the &#8220;Valentine meat-juice incident.&#8221; Of this I know no
more now than is included in my statement at the trial&mdash;namely,
that at my husband&#8217;s urgent, piteous request I placed a powder
(which by his direction I took from a pocket in his vest, hanging in
the adjoining room, which room until his sickness had been his private
bedroom, he having been removed to mine as being larger and more airy)
in a bottle of meat juice, no part of the contents of which were given
him, and hence at the very most there could only have legally arisen
from this act a charge of &#8220;intent to poison.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not assume that I can solve a problem that has puzzled so many
able minds, but I trust I shall make clear that the prosecution can
not acquit itself of the inference of &#8220;cooking&#8221; up a case
against me with reference to this meat-juice incident:</p>

<p>1. At the inquest, only a few days after<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> the occurrence, Nurse
Gore testified, &#8220;I could and did see <em>clearly</em> what Mrs. Maybrick
did with the bottle,&#8221; though she failed to tell what she saw;
and it is remarkable she was not further questioned on this point. At
the magisterial inquiry and trial, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</i>, she testified that
&#8220;she [I] pushed the door to conceal (note the animus) her [my]
movements&#8221;; but on cross-examination she so far corrected herself
as to say: &#8220;Mrs. Maybrick did <em>not</em> shut the dressing-room
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. When I returned with the bottle to the sick-room, she
testified that I placed it on the table in a &#8220;<em>surreptitious
manner</em>,&#8221; though this action, according to her own testimony,
happened while &#8220;she [I] raised her right hand and replaced the
bottle on the table, while she [I] was talking to me [her].&#8221;</p>

<p>If one wanted to do such an act &#8220;surreptitiously,&#8221; would
one choose the moment of all others when by conversation one is calling
attention to oneself? Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373"
id="Page_373">[373]</a></span> not the two things involve a direct
contradiction?</p>

<p>3. It is in evidence that an hour after I had placed the bottle on a
little table in the window, I returned to the room and removed it from
the table to the washstand (where it remained during most of the next
day), lest the sight of it should renew Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s desire for
it, as he had just awakened. Note how this bottle is juggled with by
the witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p>Michael Maybrick, at the inquest, in answer to the question,
&#8220;Where did you find the Valentine&#8217;s meat juice?&#8221;
replied: &#8220;I found it on a <em>little table mixed up</em> with
<em>several other bottles</em>.&#8221; Note the particularity of this
bottle being <em>mixed up with several other bottles</em>. Obviously he at
this time, only a few days after the event, had a clear picture of
the situation in his mind. In corroboration of this testimony that
the bottle <em>he took</em> was on the table and <em>not on the washstand</em>,
there is the testimony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374"
id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> Nurse Callery, who at the inquest
stated: &#8220;My attention was called by her [Nurse Gore] to a
bottle of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice, which was on <em>a table</em> in
Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s room. I took a sample. I don&#8217;t know what
became of the bottle of meat juice. I saw Mr. Michael Maybrick in the
room before going off duty at 4.50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on
Friday, but did not see him take the meat juice away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nurse Gore gave her testimony at the inquest <em>after</em> the two
others, and deposed that Mr. Michael Maybrick took the bottle from
the <em>washstand</em> where I had placed it, thus contradicting Michael
Maybrick, and in a way also Nurse Callery, who testified that Nurse
Gore called her attention to a bottle on the <em>small table</em>. Obviously
this difference introduces <em>two</em> bottles; but this would never answer
the prosecution, and accordingly Mr. Michael Maybrick at the trial
dropped <em>the table</em> sworn to at the inquest and fell in line with
Nurse Gore in so far as to say: &#8220;It was standing on the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<em>washstand</em>, and it was <em>among some other bottles</em>.&#8221; Note
that, while he substitutes the <em>washstand</em> for the <em>table</em>, he still
clings to the <em>bottles</em>&mdash;a most important circumstance&mdash;as
it was indubitably shown that there were on the <em>washstand</em> only the
&#8220;ordinary basins and jugs&#8221; (water pitchers). Obviously
Mr. Michael Maybrick had not fully comprehended the purpose of the
prosecution in &#8220;harmonizing&#8221; the testimony with that of
Nurse Gore; the &#8220;bottles&#8221; were too clearly in his mind to
be dropped without a distinct effort, and he naturally introduced them
again; and, to fit in with the Nurse Gore and the amended Mr. Michael
Maybrick evidence, Nurse Callery also changed front at the trial, and
the <em>table</em> of her inquest testimony is also turned into a washstand.
It is in evidence that as late as the 6th of May my husband took
meat juice out of a bottle then in the room, the contents of which,
however, did not agree with him, and upon the <em>order of Dr. Humphreys</em>
its giving was discontinued, he adding that he was &#8220;not<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
surprised,&#8221; as it was known not to agree with some people.</p>

<p>Although this was the doctor&#8217;s order, Mr. Edwin Maybrick took
it upon himself to procure a fresh bottle, and, distinctly against
the same order, Nurse Gore set about to administer its contents.
Subsequently a bottle of meat juice, half full, was found in a small
wooden box with other bottles (one of them containing arsenic in
solution) in my husband&#8217;s hat-box.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though we are here undeniably dealing with <em>three</em>
meat-juice bottles, only two were accounted for at the trial. What
became of the third bottle? And which of the <em>three</em> was missing? Now,
furthermore, it is in evidence that Nurse Callery handled one of these
bottles (between the time that I placed one on the washstand and the
time when Mr. Michael Maybrick, more than twelve hours later, took one
either from the <em>table</em> or the <em>washstand</em> for analysis), for she took
a sample of it, which she afterward threw away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377"
id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>As all Valentine&#8217;s meat-juice bottles look alike, Mr. Michael
Maybrick showed sufficient caution to say he could not identify
the bottle shown him; but Nurse Gore, to whom every act of mine,
however innocent, was fraught with &#8220;surreptitiousness&#8221;
and &#8220;suspicion,&#8221; balked at no such scruples, but boldly
testified that the bottle produced in court was the identical one that
Mr. Michael Maybrick &#8220;took from the washstand,&#8221; even though
at the inquest, when his memory was freshest, he testified that he took
it from the <em>table</em>.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that my statement to the court was to the
effect that I put a powder (its nature unknown to me) in the meat-juice
bottle I had in my hands. Yet no bottle containing a powder, or in
which a powder had been dissolved, appeared in evidence. According
to the analyst, the bottle submitted to him contained arsenic that
had been put in in a state of solution. Now it resolves itself to
this: either I uttered a falsehood about the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> powder and really
introduced a solution, or another bottle was substituted for the one I
had for two minutes in my possession.</p>

<p>The contention of the prosecution was that I &#8220;invented&#8221;
the powder, precisely as it was contended I &#8220;invented&#8221;
the face-wash prescription which was found after the trial. If I
&#8220;invented&#8221; the powder, how did I come by the solution? If
I had had arsenic in solution in my possession, would I have gone to
the trouble of making a solution for a face wash by the clumsy method
of soaking fly-papers? Is not the proposition quite absurd on its
face&mdash;that I should openly call attention to a method of arsenic
extraction with the object of murder, when I already had the means at
my command?</p>

<p>Finally, let it be borne in mind, as stated by Justice Stephen
himself as a remarkable fact, that no arsenic was traced to my
procurement or found in my personal belongings (save and except
the innocuous fly-papers), and I may add that no arsenic was<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
traced to any one connected with the case, except to my husband.</p>

<p>I say it is absolutely clear that the bottle of Valentine&#8217;s
meat juice which Mr. Michael Maybrick took possession of and handed
to Dr. Carter is not the same bottle which Nurse Gore saw me place on
the washstand. There should be no flaw in the identity of the bottle
which was handed to the analyst and the one which was in my hands, and
I think the reader will say that it is impossible to conceive a greater
<em>flaw in any evidence of identity</em> than shown by these witnesses of the
prosecution at the inquest, when their minds were freshest as to their
respective parts in this incident, and at the trial.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who follow the analysis of the testimony as
presented by Messrs. Lumley &amp; Lumley can hardly have failed
to be impressed by the fact that I was surrounded by unscrupulous
enemies, by people who not only had extraordinary knowledge as
to where to look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380"
id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> deposits of arsenic, but also remarkable
intuitions that arsenic had been administered before any evidence of
the presence of poison had been analytically proven.</p>

<p>In the above I have not aimed to make an analysis of the testimony,
such as, for example, on the evidence now available, Lord Russell could
have made; I have simply endeavored to satisfy my readers that I have
substantial grounds for asserting my innocence before the world.</p>

<h2>MEMORIALS FOR RESPITE OF SENTENCE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">From the Physicians of Liverpool</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> a memorial for
respite of sentence of Mrs. Maybrick, which was signed by leading
medical practitioners of Liverpool, the petitioners say in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;3. It was admitted by the medical testimony on behalf of
the prosecution that the symptoms during life and the post-mortem
appearances were in themselves insufficient to justify the conclusion
that death was caused by arsenic, and that it was only the discovery of
traces of that poison in certain parts of the viscera which eventually
led to that conclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. The arsenic so found in the viscera was less in quantity
than <em>that found in any previous case of arsenical poisoning in which
arsenic has been found at all</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382"
id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;5. There was indisputable evidence on the part of the defense
that the deceased had been in the habit of taking arsenic, both
medicinally and otherwise, for many years, and that the small quantity
found in the viscera was inconsistent with the theory of a fatal dose
at any time or times during the period covered by the illness of the
deceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;6. Lastly, your memorialists agree with the evidence given
by Dr. Tidy, Dr. Macnamara, and Mr. Paul on behalf of the defense,
that the medical evidence on behalf of the prosecution <em>had entirely
failed to prove that the death was due to arsenical poisoning at
all</em>.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">From the Bars of Liverpool and
London</span></h3>

<p>Leading members of the Bars of Liverpool and London signed a
memorial praying a reprieve of Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s sentence &#8220;on
the ground ... of the great conflict of medical testimony as to the
cause of death&#8221; of Mr. Maybrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">From Citizens of Liverpool</span></h3>

<p>A petition for reprieve of Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s sentence was signed
by many and influential citizens of Liverpool. Among the reasons urged
were:</p>

<p>3. Lack of direct evidence of administration of arsenic.</p>

<p>4. The weak case against prisoner on general facts unduly prejudiced
by evidence of motive.</p>

<p>5. Preponderance of medical testimony that death was ascribable to
natural causes.</p>

<div class="blockquot f90">

<p>[I feel a deep respect for the noble avowal given in the petition
of the medical practitioners of Liverpool, who must have felt the
honor of their profession at stake, and that their individual dignity
and humanity were concerned. The feeling among the Bar on receipt
of the verdict was an almost universal, if not a quite unanimous,
one of surprise. I have already mentioned (in Part One), the change
of attitude of the citizens of Liverpool toward me, as the trial
progressed, from hostility to belief in my innocence.&mdash;F. E.

<h2>NEW EVIDENCE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Arsenic Sold to Maybrick by Druggist</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">MR. EDWIN GARNETT HEATON, a retired chemist
(druggist), formerly carried on business at 14 Exchange Street East,
Liverpool, for seventeen years; he retired from business in 1888. He
testified at the trial:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Mr. Maybrick called frequently at my shop for about
ten years or more, off and on. He used to get the tonic called
&#8216;pick-me-up.&#8217; He would come to the shop, get it, and drink
it up. He gave me a prescription which altered it, which I put up
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liquor arsenicalis</i>. He brought the prescription for the first
few times; I used afterward to give it him at once, when he came into
the shop and gave his order. I prepared the &#8216;pick-me-up&#8217;
and added the stuff. At the beginning of giving it to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
him, a certain quantity of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liquor arsenicalis</i> was given, and as it
continued it was gradually increased from first to last, so at the last
it was 75 per cent. greater in quantity than it was originally. He used
to get it from two to five times a day, and each containing 75 per
cent. increase.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This testimony of Mr. Heaton&#8217;s was challenged by the
prosecution, and considerably nullified by the fact that he did not
know Mr. Maybrick, his customer, by name, but identified him by a
photograph. To show how inexorably one fatality after another was
woven into the web of my tragic case, it is in order to state that Mr.
Heaton&#8217;s connection with Mr. Maybrick could and would undoubtedly
have been perfectly established but for what in the circumstances
can be characterized only as a criminal blunder on the part of the
police. In the printed police list of the score or more medicine
bottles found locked in the private desk of Mr. Maybrick at his office
was one entered as follows: &#8220;Spirit of salvolatile,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span> Edwin
G. Easton, Exchange Street East, Liverpool.&#8221; This misprint of
Easton for Heaton escaped the attention of everybody at the trial, and
thus prevented the defense from identifying most circumstantially Mr.
Maybrick with Mr. Heaton&#8217;s customer who had the arsenic habit.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Arsenic Supplied to Maybrick by Manufacturing
Chemist</span></h3>

<p>About ten years ago Mr. Valentine Charles Blake, of Victoria
Embankment, son of a well-known baronet and Member of Parliament,
made a voluntary statutory declaration [corroborated on oath in every
possible essential by William Bryer Nation, of No. 7 Lion Street, a
manufacturing chemist and patentee], that Mr. Maybrick, about two
months before his death, procured through him (Mr. Blake), from Mr.
Nation&#8217;s supplies, as much as 150 grains of arsenic in various
forms. Mr. Nation, assisted by Mr. Blake, had made certain<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
chemical experiments in preparing ramie, the fiber of rhea grass, to
serve as a substitute for cotton. Among other ingredients used was
arsenic, some in pure form (white arsenic), some mixed with soot, and
some mixed with charcoal. In January, 1889, the process was perfected,
and some time during the same month Mr. Nation sent Mr. Blake to see
Mr. Maybrick, to get his assistance in placing the product on the
market. Mr. Maybrick was interested in the proposition and inquired
closely into the nature of the process, what ingredients were used,
etc. The deponent told him that, among other materials, arsenic was
employed.</p>

<p>Then, to quote the exact words of the deposition, Mr. Blake went on
to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;14. The said Mr. Maybrick shortly afterward, during
discussion at the same interview, asked me whether I had heard that
many inhabitants of Styria, in Austria, habitually took arsenic
internally and throve upon it. I said that I had heard so.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
He then spoke to me of De Quincey, the author of &#8216;Confessions
of an Opium-Eater,&#8217; and asked me had I read the work. I said,
&#8216;Yes,&#8217; and that I wondered De Quincey could have taken
such a quantity as 900 drops of laudanum in a day. The said James
Maybrick said, &#8216;One man&#8217;s poison is another man&#8217;s
meat, and there is a so-called poison which is like meat and liquor to
me whenever I feel weak and depressed. It makes me stronger in mind
and in body at once,&#8217; or words to that effect. I ventured to ask
him what it was. He answered, &#8216;I don&#8217;t tell everybody, and
wouldn&#8217;t tell you, only you mentioned arsenic. It is arsenic. I
take it when I can get it, but the doctors won&#8217;t put any into my
medicine except now and then a trifle, that only tantalizes me,&#8217;
or words to that effect. After a pause, during which I said nothing,
the said James Maybrick said: &#8216;Since you use arsenic, can you
let me have some? I find a difficulty in getting it here.&#8217; I
answered that I had some by me, and that, since I had only used it
for experiments which were now perfected, I had no further use for
it, and he (Maybrick) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389"
id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> welcome to all I had left. He then asked
me what it was worth, and offered to pay for it in advance. I replied
that I had no license to sell drugs, and suggested that we should make
it a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</i>. Mr. Maybrick was to do his best with the ramie
grass product, and I was to make him a present of the arsenic I had.</p>

<p>&#8220;15. It was finally agreed that when I came to Liverpool
again, as arranged I should bring with me and hand him the arsenic
aforesaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;16. <i>In February, 1889</i>, I again called at the office of
the said James Maybrick, in Liverpool, and, as promised, I handed
him all the arsenic I had at my command, amounting to about 150
grains, some of the &#8216;white&#8217; and some of the two kinds
of &#8216;black&#8217; arsenic, in three separate paper packets. I
told him to be careful, as he had &#8216;almost enough to poison
a regiment.&#8217; When we separated the said James Maybrick took
away the said arsenic with him, saying he was going home to his
house at Aigburth, to which he invited me. Having a train to catch,
I declined the invitation, promising to accept it on my next<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span> visit
to Liverpool, but before that occurred I read of his death.</p>

<p>&#8220;17. After the wife of the said James Maybrick had been
accused of his alleged murder, I wrote to Mr. Cleaver, her then
solicitor, of Liverpool, to the effect that I could give some evidence
which might be of use to his client, and I posted such letter but
received no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;18. At this time I was intensely anxious as to the fate of
my only son, Valentine Blake, who had in the previous year sailed
on board the ship <cite>Melanasia</cite> from South Shields for Valparaiso,
which ship was then very long overdue and unheard of. I eventually
learned, as a result of a Board of Trade inquiry, that the said ship
must have foundered with all hands, my only son included. At the
time I wrote as aforesaid to Mr. Cleaver, my entire attention was
engrossed in endeavoring to get news as to the ship which never came
home, and I felt little interest in any other subject. Receiving
no reply to my said letter to Mr. Cleaver, I took no further steps
in the matter until, seeing recently in a newspaper that Mr.
Jonathan E. Harris, of 95<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391"
id="Page_391">[391]</a></span> Leadenhall Street, in the city of
London, was now acting for Mrs. James Maybrick and her mother, the
Baroness de Roques, I called at the offices of the said Mr. Harris and
made to him a statement.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Depositions as to Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s Arsenic
Habit</span></h3>

<p>On August 10, Henry Bliss, former proprietor of Sefton Club and
Chambers, Liverpool, made a sworn deposition, in which he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Mr. Maybrick lived in the chambers on and off several months,
and was in the habit of dosing himself. On one occasion he asked me
to leave a prescription at a well-known Liverpool chemist&#8217;s to
be made up by the time he left &#8216;Change. The chemist remarked:
&#8216;He ought to be very careful and not take an overdose of
it.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>On March 31, 1891, Franklin George Bancroft, artist and
writer, of Columbia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392"
id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> S. C., made a sworn deposition, in which
he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;1. Between the years 1874 and 1876 I was personally
acquainted with James Maybrick, late of Battlecrease House, Aigburth,
near Liverpool, merchant, deceased, who was then living in Norfolk, Va.
I was frequently in his company, and from time to time I have <em>seen
him take from his vest pocket a case resembling a cigarette case,
which contained a packet of white powders</em>, and place the contents of
one such powder on several occasions into the glass of wine (usually
Chablis, claret, or champagne) he was at the time drinking, and swallow
the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. Seeing him take this powder, I did, on one occasion, ask
him what it was, and the said James Maybrick replied, &#8216;Longevity
and fair complexion, my boy!&#8217; and he subsequently informed me
that the said white powders were composed of <em>arsenic</em> among other
ingredients.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Justice Stephen&#8217;s Retirement</span></h3>

<p>There are also facts in relation to the judge who tried the case
which, had they been anticipated at the time of the trial, could not
have failed to have had some weight, directly or indirectly, on the
minds of the jury; that is to say, his retirement from the Bench
not long afterward, in April, 1891, when, to quote his own words in
addressing the Bar, of whom he was taking leave, &#8220;he had been
made acquainted with the fact that he was regarded by some as no longer
physically capable of discharging his duties&#8221;; and it will be no
matter of surprise, to those who have read critically the summing-up of
Mr. Justice Stephen on this trial, to notice the entire change from a
favorable bias between his address to the jury on the first days of the
trial to the violent hostility shown at its conclusion.</p>

<p>This change of front can be in a manner accounted for, as
it had been suggested to the prisoner&#8217;s friends, by
a conversation on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394"
id="Page_394">[394]</a></span> the case between Mr. Justice Stephen and
another member of the Bench, Mr. Justice Grantham, at a social meeting
of an entirely private character.</p>

<p>A mental malady was developed in the judge so soon after the trial
that it was properly said to have been caused <em>by his brooding over
it</em>, and this condition increased so rapidly and markedly that his
<em>resignation was demanded</em>. It is but reasonable to suppose that
the judge&#8217;s mental incapacity reached farther back than its
discovery, and that the illogical and unjust summing-up was connected
with the mental overthrow of the otherwise able judge. And it may be
here added that Justice Stephen himself, in the second edition of the
&#8220;General Views of the Criminal Law of England, 1890,&#8221; says,
at page 173, that out of 979 cases tried before him, from January,
1885, to September, 1889, &#8220;the case of Mrs. Maybrick was the only
case in which there could be any doubt about the facts.&#8221;</p>

the solicitor in my case, and to whose unwavering faith and kindness
I owe a debt I can never hope to repay&mdash;to write to Mr. Michael
Maybrick to forward fresh photographs of my boy and girl. To this

to permit it. When the matter was further urged Mr. Michael Maybrick

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
